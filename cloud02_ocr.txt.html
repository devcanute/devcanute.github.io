<span id="L324" class="LineNr">  324 </span>passed through several printings, is now appearing in a popular general edition. I can only imagine the amusement that
<span id="L325" class="LineNr">  325 </span>the fourteenth-century monk who wrote this book would
<span id="L326" class="LineNr">  326 </span>feel at this new curn of events. I believe he would smile at
<span id="L327" class="LineNr">  327 </span>it. It would please him. It would say to him thar, side by

<span id="L329" class="LineNr">  329 </span>its own ingenuity and its increasingly remarkable achievements with technology, people in the modern age are also
<span id="L330" class="LineNr">  330 </span>aware that there is a dimension of spiritual reality in human
<span id="L331" class="LineNr">  331 </span>existence. “Thank God,” he might exclaim in his medieval
<span id="L332" class="LineNr">  332 </span>fashion, “that they have finally realized that there is no contradiction between achievements in the material world and
<span id="L333" class="LineNr">  333 </span>developing the capacities of interior awareness.”
<span id="L334" class="LineNr">  334 </span>It is more than fantasy that leads me to imagine that the
<span id="L335" class="LineNr">  335 </span>monk would say something to this effect. The spiritual dis
<span id="L336" class="LineNr">  336 </span>cipline which he taught in monasteries is essentially a technology for the inner life as a whole. Although it proceeds
<span id="L337" class="LineNr">  337 </span>within the framework of the doctrines and symbols of its

<span id="L625" class="LineNr">  625 </span>we should not permit the flurries of enthusiasm engendered

<span id="L637" class="LineNr">  637 </span>Modern man has turned to psychology out of the fullness of a serious personal need; and it is a need that is more
<span id="L638" class="LineNr">  638 </span>than personal but historical and spiritual as well. In certain

<span id="L644" class="LineNr">  644 </span>
<span id="L645" class="LineNr">  645 </span>direction.
<span id="L646" class="LineNr">  646 </span>
<span id="L647" class="LineNr">  647 </span>Freud set the predominant tone of psychological work
<span id="L648" class="LineNr">  648 </span>with his neurological emphasis on pathology, and with his
<span id="L649" class="LineNr">  649 </span>reductive, self-analytical procedure. In the course of the
<span id="L650" class="LineNr">  650 </span>
<span id="L651" class="LineNr">  651 </span>first half of the twentieth century, this attitude of analytical self-consciousness has seeped into the mentality of
<span id="L652" class="LineNr">  652 </span>our time to a degree that has led more than one author to
<span id="L653" class="LineNr">  653 </span>refer to the modern period as a predominantly “psychological era.” When we consider the situation in perspective,
<span id="L654" class="LineNr">  654 </span>however, we realize that the absorption of the psychoanalytical point of view into the thought of our times
<span id="L655" class="LineNr">  655 </span>represents only an early and transitory phase in the de~
<span id="L656" class="LineNr">  656 </span>velopment of modern man’s knowledge of himself.
<span id="L657" class="LineNr">  657 </span>Man’s psychological awareness in modern times began
<span id="L658" class="LineNr">  658 </span>with psychoanalysis; but it does not end with that. There
<span id="L659" class="LineNr">  659 </span>are many indications that Freud, as an originator of a way
<span id="L660" class="LineNr">  660 </span>of thinking, led the way into fields of study that will

<span id="L664" class="LineNr">  664 </span>the conceptions with which psychoanalysis began; and
<span id="L665" class="LineNr">  665 </span>now that Freud’s intimate life story has been disclosed,*
<span id="L666" class="LineNr">  666 </span>we have convincing evidence that, had Freud known the
<span id="L667" class="LineNr">  667 </span>full richness of the field he had discovered, he would have
<span id="L668" class="LineNr">  668 </span>been as interested in its spiritual exploration as the new

<span id="L723" class="LineNr">  723 </span>this regard. In their efforts to carry out laboratory procedures to the ultimate of correctness, they occasionally

<span id="L753" class="LineNr">  753 </span>
<span id="L754" class="LineNr">  754 </span>and the spirit of science must be held to unswervingly.
<span id="L755" class="LineNr">  755 </span>
<span id="L756" class="LineNr">  756 </span>On the other hand, we are faced with the objective fact
<span id="L757" class="LineNr">  757 </span>that man’s mind and emotions, both conscious and un-
<span id="L758" class="LineNr">  758 </span>
<span id="L759" class="LineNr">  759 </span>conscious, are such intangible, mercurial entities that they
<span id="L760" class="LineNr">  760 </span>persistently clude intellectual grasp and scientific study.
<span id="L761" class="LineNr">  761 </span>It is more than coincidence that, in certain psychological

<span id="L764" class="LineNr">  764 </span>Because of the difficulty in studying the unconscious

<span id="L766" class="LineNr">  766 </span>the hope of developing a scientific psychology is ultimately
<span id="L767" class="LineNr">  767 </span>an unfulfillable aspiration. Psychology can be scientific, it
<span id="L768" class="LineNr">  768 </span>has been said, only at the cost of its subject matter. It can
<span id="L769" class="LineNr">  769 </span>
<span id="L770" class="LineNr">  770 </span>be scientific only if it eliminates from its sphere of study
<span id="L771" class="LineNr">  771 </span>those subjects of investigation that elude laboratory experiments

<span id="L871" class="LineNr">  871 </span>These processes may be described in terms that fit the

<span id="L1067" class="LineNr"> 1067 </span>since the day when the book was written. Words that are
<span id="L1068" class="LineNr"> 1068 </span>still in existence and are-even in common use today were
<span id="L1069" class="LineNr"> 1069 </span>used with radically different connotations in the original
<span id="L1070" class="LineNr"> 1070 </span>text. Since these meanings had long been obsolete I did
<span id="L1071" class="LineNr"> 1071 </span>not know of them;.and I assume that the same is the case
<span id="L1072" class="LineNr"> 1072 </span>for most other modern readers. Because these words are

<span id="L1080" class="LineNr"> 1080 </span>general reader who might turn to The Cloud of Unknowing with something other than a psychological interest.
<span id="L1081" class="LineNr"> 1081 </span>The original text of The Cloud of Unknowing was
<span id="L1082" class="LineNr"> 1082 </span>written in the language of daily life in fourteenth-century

<span id="L1085" class="LineNr"> 1085 </span>knowledge of God that they might verify by their own
<span id="L1086" class="LineNr"> 1086 </span>experience. Accordingly, the author addressed himself
<span id="L1087" class="LineNr"> 1087 </span>neither to the academic men nor to the clergy, but he

<span id="L1104" class="LineNr"> 1104 </span>experience, and it was thus described and referred to in

<span id="L1106" class="LineNr"> 1106 </span>the language of everyday affairs with colloquial expressions

<span id="L1108" class="LineNr"> 1108 </span>
<span id="L1109" class="LineNr"> 1109 </span>was a monk he was in close touch with the secular life
<span id="L1110" class="LineNr"> 1110 </span>
<span id="L1111" class="LineNr"> 1111 </span>of his times. He was interested in reaching people on all
<span id="L1112" class="LineNr"> 1112 </span>levels of society. He therefore used the terms of ordinary
<span id="L1113" class="LineNr"> 1113 </span>speech so that he might strike the largest common denominator by speaking of man’s relation to God in words
<span id="L1114" class="LineNr"> 1114 </span>
<span id="L1115" class="LineNr"> 1115 </span>that everyone would be able to understand.
<span id="L1116" class="LineNr"> 1116 </span>
<span id="L1117" class="LineNr"> 1117 </span>In order to be true to the original text, it has been
<span id="L1118" class="LineNr"> 1118 </span>essential that this modern version be rendered wherever
<span id="L1119" class="LineNr"> 1119 </span>
<span id="L1120" class="LineNr"> 1120 </span>possible into the colloquial language of everyday speech.
<span id="L1121" class="LineNr"> 1121 </span>Otherwise one could get an entirely erroneous impression
<span id="L1122" class="LineNr"> 1122 </span>of The Cloud of Unknowing. It was addressed to everyone, to everyone, that is, who felt a desire for personally

<span id="L1200" class="LineNr"> 1200 </span>
<span id="L1201" class="LineNr"> 1201 </span>The Cloud of Unknowing describes requires that the individual be led beyond

<span id="L1217" class="LineNr"> 1217 </span>of three main versions of the original text published in

<span id="L1227" class="LineNr"> 1227 </span>of The Early English Text Society of London. To each
<span id="L1228" class="LineNr"> 1228 </span>of these editors and to their publishers, I tender my great
<span id="L1229" class="LineNr"> 1229 </span>and sincere appreciation.*
<span id="L1230" class="LineNr"> 1230 </span>These three versions provided me with a kind of consensus against which to check my modern rendition. In
<span id="L1231" class="LineNr"> 1231 </span>general I have held to the original text of The Cloud of
<span id="L1232" class="LineNr"> 1232 </span>Unknowing as closely as possible while replacing old words
<span id="L1233" class="LineNr"> 1233 </span>with new ones to convey the author’s meaning. I have
<span id="L1234" class="LineNr"> 1234 </span>also restructured the sentences wherever necessary in order
<span id="L1235" class="LineNr"> 1235 </span>to make certain that the free flow of the thought would
<span id="L1236" class="LineNr"> 1236 </span>not be hindered by archaic syntax. At various points in
<span id="L1237" class="LineNr"> 1237 </span>the text, however, the reader will find that obsolete words
<span id="L1238" class="LineNr"> 1238 </span>have been deliberately retained. These are words that have
<span id="L1239" class="LineNr"> 1239 </span>gone out of currency but which have a special pungency
<span id="L1240" class="LineNr"> 1240 </span>and impact in the form in which the author employs
<span id="L1241" class="LineNr"> 1241 </span>them. Wherever possible, I have left the original phrases
<span id="L1242" class="LineNr"> 1242 </span>in such cases, and my criterion has been to see whether
<span id="L1243" class="LineNr"> 1243 </span>the meaning of the word becomes clear from the immediate context in which it appears. In such cases I have
<span id="L1244" class="LineNr"> 1244 </span>substituted another word only when the phrase was used
<span id="L1245" class="LineNr"> 1245 </span>in a different sense or in a different context. Throughout,
<span id="L1246" class="LineNr"> 1246 </span>the aim has been to capture and convey the spirit of the
<span id="L1247" class="LineNr"> 1247 </span>original document so that the modern reader can feel
<span id="L1248" class="LineNr"> 1248 </span>sympathetically, and perhaps experience for himself, what
<span id="L1249" class="LineNr"> 1249 </span>the author was trying to say and trying to do.

<span id="L1287" class="LineNr"> 1287 </span>independent inquiry and individual experience; and this
<span id="L1288" class="LineNr"> 1288 </span>‘was a point of view to which the author of The Cloud of
<span id="L1289" class="LineNr"> 1289 </span>Unknowing was also strongly committed.
<span id="L1290" class="LineNr"> 1290 </span>The underlying attitudes of Meister Eckhart and the
<span id="L1291" class="LineNr"> 1291 </span>author of The Cloud of Unknowing have a great deal in

<span id="L1293" class="LineNr"> 1293 </span>and the consequent nearness of the Inquisitor as well—that
<span id="L1294" class="LineNr"> 1294 </span>the author of The Cloud of Unknowing constantly avows
<span id="L1295" class="LineNr"> 1295 </span>his horror of all forms of heresy. We do not know whether
<span id="L1296" class="LineNr"> 1296 </span>he was ever formally charged with heresy himself, but, at
<span id="L1297" class="LineNr"> 1297 </span>the very best, he must have lived a precarious existence
<span id="L1298" class="LineNr"> 1298 </span>if his authorship was known during his lifetime. It was
<span id="L1299" class="LineNr"> 1299 </span>only in later generations that the Roman Catholic Church
<span id="L1300" class="LineNr"> 1300 </span>recognized the legitimacy of this direct, personal approach
<span id="L1301" class="LineNr"> 1301 </span>to religious experience and gave it official sanction and
<span id="L1302" class="LineNr"> 1302 </span>encouragement.
<span id="L1303" class="LineNr"> 1303 </span>The thirteenth century with its encompassing synthesis
<span id="L1304" class="LineNr"> 1304 </span>of reason and faith as composed by Saint Thomas Aquinas
<span id="L1305" class="LineNr"> 1305 </span>had brought everything into order. Religious knowledge
<span id="L1306" class="LineNr"> 1306 </span>had reached its highest point according to the official pronouncement of the time; but the interesting fact is that
<span id="L1307" class="LineNr"> 1307 </span>the period directly after the generation of Saint Thomas,
<span id="L1308" class="LineNr"> 1308 </span>in direct contrast to the systematized, reasonable orderliness of Thomas's integration, was a time of spiritual turbulence in which the most varied mystical movements
<span id="L1309" class="LineNr"> 1309 </span>mushroomed all through Europe from England to Italy.
<span id="L1310" class="LineNr"> 1310 </span>The system that the Scholastics had proclaimed does
<span id="L1311" class="LineNr"> 1311 </span>not seem to have sufficed for many of the Roman Catholic
<span id="L1312" class="LineNr"> 1312 </span>brethren of the time. They felt a pressing need to come
<span id="L1313" class="LineNr"> 1313 </span>close to God directly and spontancously in terms of the
<span id="L1314" class="LineNr"> 1314 </span>intense immediacy of their individual religious promptings.

<span id="L1328" class="LineNr"> 1328 </span>seemed to me that to number the paragraphs will provide

<span id="L1330" class="LineNr"> 1330 </span>without reference to page number, the fourth paragraph
<span id="L1331" class="LineNr"> 1331 </span>in the thirey-cighth chapter may simply be referred to for

<span id="L1344" class="LineNr"> 1344 </span>likelihood he did so not out of modesty but out of
<span id="L1345" class="LineNr"> 1345 </span>prudence.

<span id="L1350" class="LineNr"> 1350 </span>were active throughout western Europe during that

<span id="L1378" class="LineNr"> 1378 </span>to aptly by Rufus Jones as “the flowering of mysticism,”
<span id="L1379" class="LineNr"> 1379 </span>and while it was strongest in the German-speaking areas

<span id="L1382" class="LineNr"> 1382 </span>The author of The Cloud of Unknowing seems to have
<span id="L1383" class="LineNr"> 1383 </span>
<span id="L1384" class="LineNr"> 1384 </span>been one of the most energetic, and certainly one of the
<span id="L1385" class="LineNr"> 1385 </span>most competent figures in this period of spiritual ferment
<span id="L1386" class="LineNr"> 1386 </span>and controversy in medieval Christianity. He wrote sev-

<span id="L1391" class="LineNr"> 1391 </span>
<span id="L1392" class="LineNr"> 1392 </span>Unknowing stands out, however, as his most important
<span id="L1393" class="LineNr"> 1393 </span>vork. It is the one that expresses most articulately the
<span id="L1394" class="LineNr"> 1394 </span>otinciples of his teaching and in which the meaning of his
<span id="L1395" class="LineNr"> 1395 </span>

<span id="L1400" class="LineNr"> 1400 </span>It seems certain that our unknown author was a monk

<span id="L1402" class="LineNr"> 1402 </span>of some denomination; but there is no agreement as to
<span id="L1403" class="LineNr"> 1403 </span>
<span id="L1404" class="LineNr"> 1404 </span>the specific order to which he belonged. The fact that he
<span id="L1405" class="LineNr"> 1405 </span>spent the last years of his life in monastic seclusion seems
<span id="L1406" class="LineNr"> 1406 </span>to be indicated by the tone of his writings; but it is con-
<span id="L1407" class="LineNr"> 1407 </span>
<span id="L1408" class="LineNr"> 1408 </span>sidered probable that he was a secular priest, and that
<span id="L1409" class="LineNr"> 1409 </span>perhaps in his younger years he was not a priest at all.
<span id="L1410" class="LineNr"> 1410 </span>One of the most intriguing aspects of The Cloud of

<span id="L1412" class="LineNr"> 1412 </span>blunt and earthy tone. They were obviously not the work
<span id="L1413" class="LineNr"> 1413 </span>of a man who had confined himself to a monastic ivory

<span id="L1416" class="LineNr"> 1416 </span>by a person who was particularly familiar with the frailties

<span id="L1433" class="LineNr"> 1433 </span>Just the opposite, indeed. The Cloud of Unknowing was
<span id="L1434" class="LineNr"> 1434 </span>written by someone who was exceedingly tough-minded
<span id="L1435" class="LineNr"> 1435 </span>in the sense in which William James used the phrase. He
<span id="L1436" class="LineNr"> 1436 </span>‘was most unsentimental, matter of fact, and down to earth;
<span id="L1437" class="LineNr"> 1437 </span>and he regarded this habit of mind as a prerequisite for
<span id="L1438" class="LineNr"> 1438 </span>the work in which he was engaged. He proceeded upon
<span id="L1439" class="LineNr"> 1439 </span>the belief that when an individual undertakes to bring his
<span id="L1440" class="LineNr"> 1440 </span>life into relation to God, he is embarking upon a serious
<span id="L1441" class="LineNr"> 1441 </span>and demanding task, a task that leaves no leeway for selfdeception or illusion. It requires the most rigorous dedi
<span id="L1442" class="LineNr"> 1442 </span>cation and self-knowledge. The Cloud of Unknowing is
<span id="L1443" class="LineNr"> 1443 </span>therefore a book of strong and earnest thinking. It rnakes
<span id="L1444" class="LineNr"> 1444 </span>a realistic appraisal of the problems and weaknesses of
<span id="L1445" class="LineNr"> 1445 </span>individual human
<span id="L1446" class="LineNr"> 1446 </span>beings, for it regards man’s imperfections
<span id="L1447" class="LineNr"> 1447 </span>as the raw material to be worked with in carrying out the
<span id="L1448" class="LineNr"> 1448 </span>discipline of spiritual development.
<span id="L1449" class="LineNr"> 1449 </span>The author states that the specific purpose for which he
<span id="L1450" class="LineNr"> 1450 </span>was writing The Cloud of Unknowing was to provide
<span id="L1451" class="LineNr"> 1451 </span>guidance for a young man twenty-four years of age who
<span id="L1452" class="LineNr"> 1452 </span>was seriously considering taking a step that would commit

<span id="L1454" class="LineNr"> 1454 </span>Ostensibly the book is written for this young man personally to help him reach a decision by indicating the

<span id="L1484" class="LineNr"> 1484 </span>point of view with which its author was deeply involved.

<span id="L1488" class="LineNr"> 1488 </span>that he was doing something more than set forth the
<span id="L1489" class="LineNr"> 1489 </span>psychological outlines of a religious discipline. He was
<span id="L1490" class="LineNr"> 1490 </span>satisfying a need of his own for a personal confession concerning the unconventional, highly individualized, and
<span id="L1491" class="LineNr"> 1491 </span>certainly lonely work in which he had been engaged. It is
<span id="L1492" class="LineNr"> 1492 </span>this personal confession, inadvertently revealed, that gives
<span id="L1493" class="LineNr"> 1493 </span>The Cloud of Unknowing its impressive tone of sincerity
<span id="L1494" class="LineNr"> 1494 </span>and spiritual intensity; and it also provides a main reason
<span id="L1495" class="LineNr"> 1495 </span>for our believing in the personal authenticity of the work.
<span id="L1496" class="LineNr"> 1496 </span>As the life of contemplation is referred to in the text,
<span id="L1497" class="LineNr"> 1497 </span>it seems to imply complete withdrawal from the world.
<span id="L1498" class="LineNr"> 1498 </span>The author indicates, however, that there is no rigid
<span id="L1499" class="LineNr"> 1499 </span>requirement. A wide flexibility is possible in the work, for
<span id="L1500" class="LineNr"> 1500 </span>there are several levels at which the life of the contemplative can be experienced. He makes the more basic point as
<span id="L1501" class="LineNr"> 1501 </span>well that it is not the physical withdrawal from the secular
<span id="L1502" class="LineNr"> 1502 </span>world into the cloister that is the essential thing. What is
<span id="L1503" class="LineNr"> 1503 </span>more important is the withdrawal of psychological attach

<span id="L1505" class="LineNr"> 1505 </span>The implication then is present in the text that the life of
<span id="L1506" class="LineNr"> 1506 </span>contemplation and union with God may involve the fully
<span id="L1507" class="LineNr"> 1507 </span>isolated monastic life, or it may not. Either path may lead
<span id="L1508" class="LineNr"> 1508 </span>to the ultimate goal, and in varying degrees. Grace and
<span id="L1509" class="LineNr"> 1509 </span>the spontaneous love of God are more important than any
<span id="L1510" class="LineNr"> 1510 </span>of the physical conditions of life. The author develops

<span id="L1515" class="LineNr"> 1515 </span>of the elastic strength and wisdom found in the Japanese

<span id="L1519" class="LineNr"> 1519 </span>The term contemplative carries overtones of passivity

<span id="L1539" class="LineNr"> 1539 </span>capable of a closer relationship with God. Far from being
<span id="L1540" class="LineNr"> 1540 </span>passive, then, the contemplative life is decidedly active,
<span id="L1541" class="LineNr"> 1541 </span>for it involves a most ambitious spiritual enterprise.
<span id="L1542" class="LineNr"> 1542 </span>
<span id="L1543" class="LineNr"> 1543 </span>There are, however, several obstacles that hinder the

<span id="L1547" class="LineNr"> 1547 </span>mean in practice. For one thing, the descriptions of this

<span id="L1592" class="LineNr"> 1592 </span>begun to show itself. It is necessary, therefore, if we wish
<span id="L1593" class="LineNr"> 1593 </span>to understand the creative activity expressed in the contemplative life as The Cloud of Unknowing describes it,
<span id="L1594" class="LineNr"> 1594 </span>to divest ourselves temporarily of our habitual mode of

<span id="L1604" class="LineNr"> 1604 </span>in terms of the sameness of their essential quest. All that

<span id="L2170" class="LineNr"> 2170 </span>underlying all things. An example of a Koan would be:
<span id="L2171" class="LineNr"> 2171 </span>“What are your original features which you have even
<span id="L2172" class="LineNr"> 2172 </span>prior to your birth?” or “Listen to the sound of one
<span id="L2173" class="LineNr"> 2173 </span>hand.”*
<span id="L2174" class="LineNr"> 2174 </span>When he receives his Koan, the disciple directs himself
<span id="L2175" class="LineNr"> 2175 </span>toward finding a solution. He has been instructed to pro
<span id="L2176" class="LineNr"> 2176 </span>ceed by means of his “abdomen” rather than his “head.”
<span id="L2177" class="LineNr"> 2177 </span>That is to say, the master advises him to seek to solve his
<span id="L2178" class="LineNr"> 2178 </span>problem not by conscious or intellectual reasoning, but
<span id="L2179" class="LineNr"> 2179 </span>out of the subliminal levels of his mind without the use of
<span id="L2180" class="LineNr"> 2180 </span>consciousness. This advice, we notice, is the same as that
<span id="L2181" class="LineNr"> 2181 </span>given by the author of The Cloud of Unknowing.
<span id="L2182" class="LineNr"> 2182 </span>The Zen disciple then concentrates ever more intently
<span id="L2183" class="LineNr"> 2183 </span>upon solving his Koan. He draws his energy down into

<span id="L2185" class="LineNr"> 2185 </span>decreases the amount of energy available for his conscious
<span id="L2186" class="LineNr"> 2186 </span>activities. A psychological condition of abaissement then
<span id="L2187" class="LineNr"> 2187 </span>comes into effect; it is a lowering of the mental level, and
<span id="L2188" class="LineNr"> 2188 </span>this causes the disciple’s behavior to become dangerously

<span id="L2228" class="LineNr"> 2228 </span>covered over in a mist. His eyes are closed and he goes
<span id="L2229" class="LineNr"> 2229 </span>forward blindly. Now he is walking across the proverbial
<span id="L2230" class="LineNr"> 2230 </span>razor’s edge without being able to see, without even thinking to look where he is stepping. On cither side lies
<span id="L2231" class="LineNr"> 2231 </span>psychosis; somewhere, wherever the interminable razor’s
<span id="L2232" class="LineNr"> 2232 </span>edge ends; there lies Satori.
<span id="L2233" class="LineNr"> 2233 </span>‘Then, suddenly, there comes a shell-breaking insight, a
<span id="L2234" class="LineNr"> 2234 </span>spontaneous outcry. Having been completely lost to himself and unaware of what he was doing, the Zen disciple
<span id="L2235" class="LineNr"> 2235 </span>has found the greater Self he originally came to seek. He
<span id="L2236" class="LineNr"> 2236 </span>can now return to his former station in life, the same
<span id="L2237" class="LineNr"> 2237 </span>person, but altogether different.
<span id="L2238" class="LineNr"> 2238 </span>From this brief description, we can follow the psychological parallel between the Zen disciple and person who
<span id="L2239" class="LineNr"> 2239 </span>secks enlightenment by means of The Cloud of Unknowing. Both begin their work by withdrawing their attention from their surroundings and by concentrating their
<span id="L2240" class="LineNr"> 2240 </span>energies within themselves. A psychological consequence
<span id="L2241" class="LineNr"> 2241 </span>of this is thar the social contacts that ordinarily stimulate
<span id="L2242" class="LineNr"> 2242 </span>conscious development now dwindle.
<span id="L2243" class="LineNr"> 2243 </span>The individual's conscious activities steadily diminish
<span id="L2244" class="LineNr"> 2244 </span>and grow weaker at this point. His awareness of himself
<span id="L2245" class="LineNr"> 2245 </span>grows dim. He continues in his work; that is, he continues
<span id="L2246" class="LineNr"> 2246 </span>in his effort to solve the problem he has set himself regarding the paradox of existence; to discover how man, separated by nature from God, can yet achieve unity with
<span id="L2247" class="LineNr"> 2247 </span>God. But he goes abour this difficult work as though he
<span id="L2248" class="LineNr"> 2248 </span>were without any conscious guidance. He is, in fact,
<span id="L2249" class="LineNr"> 2249 </span>hardly conscious at all that he is doing anything. He goes

<span id="L2280" class="LineNr"> 2280 </span>provides the medium in which his union with God may
<span id="L2281" class="LineNr"> 2281 </span>take place.
<span id="L2282" class="LineNr"> 2282 </span>Once one is altogether covered by the darkness of the
<span id="L2283" class="LineNr"> 2283 </span>cloud of unknowing, it may happen that a light unexpectedly appears. If it does come, the author tells us, it
<span id="L2284" class="LineNr"> 2284 </span>will come “merely as a sudden stirring with no forewaming, instantly springing toward God as a spark from a coal.
<span id="L2285" class="LineNr"> 2285 </span>And,” he adds, “it is wonderful to count the number of
<span id="L2286" class="LineNr"> 2286 </span>stirrings that may appear within one hour in a soul that
<span id="L2287" class="LineNr"> 2287 </span>is disposed to the work” (IV:14).
<span id="L2288" class="LineNr"> 2288 </span>Ie will be “a blind stirring of love” (IV:16). “Blind,”
<span id="L2289" class="LineNr"> 2289 </span>because its origin will have been in darkness, its movement
<span id="L2290" class="LineNr"> 2290 </span>will have been unconscious, and no guidance will direct
<span id="L2291" class="LineNr"> 2291 </span>it toward its goal. Yet it goes toward God, and it does
<span id="L2292" class="LineNr"> 2292 </span>so because ultimately it “is the work only of God”
<span id="L2293" class="LineNr"> 2293 </span>(XXVI3). Despite its “blindness,” it moves with love;
<span id="L2294" class="LineNr"> 2294 </span>and this is most essential, for “God may be reached and
<span id="L2295" class="LineNr"> 2295 </span>held close by means of love, but by means of thought
<span id="L2296" class="LineNr"> 2296 </span>never” (VI:3). Thus, this “blind stirring of love” that
<span id="L2297" class="LineNr"> 2297 </span>springs “toward God as a spark from a coal” marks the
<span id="L2298" class="LineNr"> 2298 </span>beginning of the experience of enlightenment that emerges
<span id="L2299" class="LineNr"> 2299 </span>from the cloud of unknowing.
<span id="L2300" class="LineNr"> 2300 </span>Out of the intensity of the disciple’s striving within the
<span id="L2301" class="LineNr"> 2301 </span>cloud of unknowing, a spontaneous prayer may be called
<span id="L2302" class="LineNr"> 2302 </span>forth. It will not be an eloquent prayer, but a prayer of
<span id="L2303" class="LineNr"> 2303 </span>vord, perhaps only of one syllable, such as, “God”
<span id="L2304" class="LineNr"> 2304 </span>or
<span id="L2305" class="LineNr"> 2305 </span>“Sin.” It is an involuntary outcry of a person in desperation. And since this one syllable “is prayed with a
<span id="L2306" class="LineNr"> 2306 </span>full spirit, in the height and in the depth, in the length
<span id="L2307" class="LineNr"> 2307 </span>and in the breadth of the spirit of him who prays it,” it

<span id="L2314" class="LineNr"> 2314 </span>
<span id="L2315" class="LineNr"> 2315 </span>though covered by a mist, a cloud, a darkness that hides
<span id="L2316" class="LineNr"> 2316 </span>everything he does and hides everything that takes place
<span id="L2317" class="LineNr"> 2317 </span>
<span id="L2318" class="LineNr"> 2318 </span>within him. And “when I speak of darkness,” the author
<span id="L2319" class="LineNr"> 2319 </span>of The Cloud of Unknowing says, it is not “the kind of
<span id="L2320" class="LineNr"> 2320 </span>darkness that is in your house at night when the candle is
<span id="L2321" class="LineNr"> 2321 </span>out.” It is a darkness of a quite different kind. “I am re-
<span id="L2322" class="LineNr"> 2322 </span>
<span id="L2323" class="LineNr"> 2323 </span>ferring,” he says, “to a lack of knowing. It is a lack of
<span id="L2324" class="LineNr"> 2324 </span>
<span id="L2325" class="LineNr"> 2325 </span>kmowing that includes everything you do not know or
<span id="L2326" class="LineNr"> 2326 </span>else that you have forgotten, whatever is altogether dark
<span id="L2327" class="LineNr"> 2327 </span>for you because you do not see it with your spiritual eye.
<span id="L2328" class="LineNr"> 2328 </span>
<span id="L2329" class="LineNr"> 2329 </span>And for this reason it is not called a cloud of the air, but
<span id="L2330" class="LineNr"> 2330 </span>
<span id="L2331" class="LineNr"> 2331 </span>rather a cloud of unknowing that is between you and
<span id="L2332" class="LineNr"> 2332 </span>
<span id="L2333" class="LineNr"> 2333 </span>your God” (IV:18).
<span id="L2334" class="LineNr"> 2334 </span>
<span id="L2335" class="LineNr"> 2335 </span>This last phrase, “a cloud of unknowing that is between
<span id="L2336" class="LineNr"> 2336 </span>
<span id="L2337" class="LineNr"> 2337 </span>you and your God,” is of particular interest. The word
<span id="L2338" class="LineNr"> 2338 </span>
<span id="L2339" class="LineNr"> 2339 </span>“between” has a twofold meaning here. On the one hand
<span id="L2340" class="LineNr"> 2340 </span>
<span id="L2341" class="LineNr"> 2341 </span>it signifies separation; on the other hand, connection. What
<span id="L2342" class="LineNr"> 2342 </span>is separating man from God is not any physical thing but
<span id="L2343" class="LineNr"> 2343 </span>the state of his consciousness. More specifically, it is
<span id="L2344" class="LineNr"> 2344 </span>man’s consciousness of his separateness, of his existence
<span id="L2345" class="LineNr"> 2345 </span>as an individual apart from God that keeps him separated
<span id="L2346" class="LineNr"> 2346 </span>from God. To overcome this awareness of separateness,
<span id="L2347" class="LineNr"> 2347 </span>he must place himself in a psychological situation that
<span id="L2348" class="LineNr"> 2348 </span>weakens,
<span id="L2349" class="LineNr"> 2349 </span>
<span id="L2350" class="LineNr"> 2350 </span>and

<span id="L2361" class="LineNr"> 2361 </span>to drop into a condition of unconsciousness, a condition

<span id="L2390" class="LineNr"> 2390 </span>The answer to the outcry of the disciple struggling in
<span id="L2391" class="LineNr"> 2391 </span>the darkness of the cloud of unknowing comes as an
<span id="L2392" class="LineNr"> 2392 </span>illumination. God sends him “a beam of spiritual light”
<span id="L2393" class="LineNr"> 2393 </span>which pierces the cloud of unknowing in order to reach
<span id="L2394" class="LineNr"> 2394 </span>him. And then God reveals “some of His secret ways of
<span id="L2395" class="LineNr"> 2395 </span>which man neither can nor may speak” (XXVI:5). After
<span id="L2396" class="LineNr"> 2396 </span>striving in blind unconsciousness, the disciple at last becomes able to see; and what he sees gives him knowledge,
<span id="L2397" class="LineNr"> 2397 </span>gained in his unknowing state, of a kind that ino degree
<span id="L2398" class="LineNr"> 2398 </span>of ordinary consciousness could have brought him before.
<span id="L2399" class="LineNr"> 2399 </span>This is the culminating experience of his search. “The
<span id="L2400" class="LineNr"> 2400 </span>higher part of the contemplative life,” the author tells us,
<span id="L2401" class="LineNr"> 2401 </span>“takes place altogether in this darkness and in the cloud
<span id="L2402" class="LineNr"> 2402 </span>of unknowing with a loving striving blindly beholding
<span id="L2403" class="LineNr"> 2403 </span>the naked being only of God Himself” (VIII:9).
<span id="L2404" class="LineNr"> 2404 </span>What transpires in this ultimate moment may not, however, be spoken of truly as a knowledge of God. Neither
<span id="L2405" class="LineNr"> 2405 </span>can it accurately be called a feeling of God, nor even an
<span id="L2406" class="LineNr"> 2406 </span>experience of God. It is rather a state of unity of being
<span id="L2407" class="LineNr"> 2407 </span>that is suddenly established by which God and the individual human person are together as one. And this transformation takes place in the briefest instant. “It is the
<span id="L2408" class="LineNr"> 2408 </span>shortest work that man can imagine. It is neither longer
<span id="L2409" class="LineNr"> 2409 </span>nor shorter than an atom” (IV:2).
<span id="L2410" class="LineNr"> 2410 </span>In this instant, out of the cloud of unknowing, a new
<span id="L2411" class="LineNr"> 2411 </span>unity comes into being. And when it is traly established,
<span id="L2412" class="LineNr"> 2412 </span>it is not merely a composite of two separate entities such

<span id="L2420" class="LineNr"> 2420 </span>in which the separateness of man is obliterated in God so
<span id="L2421" class="LineNr"> 2421 </span>that oneness is established as an actual fact of existence.
<span id="L2422" class="LineNr"> 2422 </span>But this is most difficult, and it seldom is fully achieved.
<span id="L2423" class="LineNr"> 2423 </span>If, for example, the individual feels or experiences himself
<span id="L2424" class="LineNr"> 2424 </span>

<span id="L2426" class="LineNr"> 2426 </span>been achieved. At such times, the author of The Cloud
<span id="L2427" class="LineNr"> 2427 </span>
<span id="L2428" class="LineNr"> 2428 </span>tells us, “If you look truly you will find,” that something
<span id="L2429" class="LineNr"> 2429 </span>is still “between you and your God” (IX:1). There is still
<span id="L2430" class="LineNr"> 2430 </span>work remaining to be done.
<span id="L2431" class="LineNr"> 2431 </span>The mere fact that the individual feels his presumed
<span id="L2432" class="LineNr"> 2432 </span>
<span id="L2433" class="LineNr"> 2433 </span>unity
<span id="L2434" class="LineNr"> 2434 </span>
<span id="L2435" class="LineNr"> 2435 </span>with God as a personal experience indicates that he
<span id="L2436" class="LineNr"> 2436 </span>
<span id="L2437" class="LineNr"> 2437 </span>is still separated from God. The individual who experiences
<span id="L2438" class="LineNr"> 2438 </span>
<span id="L2439" class="LineNr"> 2439 </span>God thereby emphasizes the duality of his own individual
<span id="L2440" class="LineNr"> 2440 </span>
<span id="L2441" class="LineNr"> 2441 </span>existence, his personal thatness, and the existence of God
<span id="L2442" class="LineNr"> 2442 </span>as separate from him. In that case it cannot be said that
<span id="L2443" class="LineNr"> 2443 </span>
<span id="L2444" class="LineNr"> 2444 </span>he knows God truly and intimately in oneness.

<span id="L3696" class="LineNr"> 3696 </span>ever deeper and deeper into sin and is drawn ever further
<span id="L3697" class="LineNr"> 3697 </span>and further away from God. But by holding to this work
<span id="L3698" class="LineNr"> 3698 </span>and working in it continually, a man rises ever higher and

<span id="L3796" class="LineNr"> 3796 </span>giver of time. He by virtue of His manhood is the very
<span id="L3797" class="LineNr"> 3797 </span>keeper of time. And He, by virtue of His Godhead and

<span id="L3922" class="LineNr"> 3922 </span>I am talking about. When I speak of darkness, I am referring to a lack of knowing. It is a lack of knowing that

<span id="L3996" class="LineNr"> 3996 </span>nevertheless in this work it is of very little help, or none

<span id="L3999" class="LineNr"> 3999 </span>God has made, or of any of their deeds, is
<span id="L4000" class="LineNr"> 4000 </span>a kind of spiritual light; for the eye of your soul opens
<span id="L4001" class="LineNr"> 4001 </span>upon it and becomes fixed upon it, as the eye of the archer
<span id="L4002" class="LineNr"> 4002 </span>is fixed on the spot at which he aims. And one thing I
<span id="L4003" class="LineNr"> 4003 </span>tell you, that whatever you think about is above you for
<span id="L4004" class="LineNr"> 4004 </span>a time and is between you and your God. And to the

<span id="L4379" class="LineNr"> 4379 </span>A good statement of certain doubts that
<span id="L4380" class="LineNr"> 4380 </span>
<span id="L4381" class="LineNr"> 4381 </span>may occur during this work, treated by
<span id="L4382" class="LineNr"> 4382 </span>
<span id="L4383" class="LineNr"> 4383 </span>question, with respect to overcoming a
<span id="L4384" class="LineNr"> 4384 </span>man’s curiosity and cunning and natural
<span id="L4385" class="LineNr"> 4385 </span>mind and distinguishing the degrees and
<span id="L4386" class="LineNr"> 4386 </span>parts of active and contemplative life
<span id="L4387" class="LineNr"> 4387 </span>
<span id="L4388" class="LineNr"> 4388 </span>1. Now you ask Me, “What is he thar thus presses
<span id="L4389" class="LineNr"> 4389 </span>upon me in this work? Is it a good thing or an evil thing?
<span id="L4390" class="LineNr"> 4390 </span>And if it is an evil thing, must we not wonder at the
<span id="L4391" class="LineNr"> 4391 </span>fact that he increases a man’s devotion so much? For sometimes it seems to me to be exceedingly pleasant to listen
<span id="L4392" class="LineNr"> 4392 </span>to his tales. One moment he makes me weep with the
<span id="L4393" class="LineNr"> 4393 </span>fullest pity of my heart for the Passion of Christ, and
<span id="L4394" class="LineNr"> 4394 </span>another moment for my own wretchedness and then for
<span id="L4395" class="LineNr"> 4395 </span>many other reasons so that it seems to me to be exceedingly holy and to have done me much good. For this reason
<span id="L4396" class="LineNr"> 4396 </span>it seems to me that he can in no sense be evil. And if
<span id="L4397" class="LineNr"> 4397 </span>he is good and if in addition he does me so much good
<span id="L4398" class="LineNr"> 4398 </span>with his pleasant stories, then I do not understand why
<span id="L4399" class="LineNr"> 4399 </span>you instruct me to press him down and away far beneath
<span id="L4400" class="LineNr"> 4400 </span>the cloud of forgetting.”
<span id="L4401" class="LineNr"> 4401 </span>
<span id="L4402" class="LineNr"> 4402 </span>2. Now IT CERTAINLY SEEMS To ME that this is a
<span id="L4403" class="LineNr"> 4403 </span>very good question, and I shall try to answer it as best
<span id="L4404" class="LineNr"> 4404 </span>I can. Firstly, when you ask what he is that presses so
<span id="L4405" class="LineNr"> 4405 </span>hard upon you in this work while offering to help you
<span id="L4406" class="LineNr"> 4406 </span>in it, I say thar it is a sharp and clear perception of means
<span id="L4407" class="LineNr"> 4407 </span>of your natural capacities expressed in your reason within
<span id="L4408" class="LineNr"> 4408 </span>your soul. And when you ask me whether it is good or
<span id="L4409" class="LineNr"> 4409 </span>evil, I answer that it must always be good in its nature.
<span id="L4410" class="LineNr"> 4410 </span>The reason for this is that it is a beam of the image of God.
<span id="L4411" class="LineNr"> 4411 </span>3. Tue use oF 17, however, may be both good and
<span id="L4412" class="LineNr"> 4412 </span>evil. It may be good when it is opened by grace in order
<span id="L4413" class="LineNr"> 4413 </span>to see the wrerchedness, the passion, the kindness, and the
<span id="L4414" class="LineNr"> 4414 </span>wonderful works of God in His creatures both physical
<span id="L4415" class="LineNr"> 4415 </span>and spiritual. In that case it must certainly increase your
<span id="L4416" class="LineNr"> 4416 </span>devotion fully as much as you
<span id="L4417" class="LineNr"> 4417 </span>4. ON THE OTHER HAND, its use is evil when it is
<span id="L4418" class="LineNr"> 4418 </span>swollen with pride and with the curiosity of much Jearning and literary cunning as in scholars, and when it makes
<span id="L4419" class="LineNr"> 4419 </span>them strive to be regarded not as meek scholars or masters
<span id="L4420" class="LineNr"> 4420 </span>of divinity or of devotion, but as proud scholars of the
<span id="L4421" class="LineNr"> 4421 </span>devil, and as masters of vanity and falsehood. In other men
<span id="L4422" class="LineNr"> 4422 </span>and women, whether they be religious or secular people,
<span id="L4423" class="LineNr"> 4423 </span>the use and working of this natural knowledge is evil when
<span id="L4424" class="LineNr"> 4424 </span>it is swollen with the proud and curious skills of worldly
<span id="L4425" class="LineNr"> 4425 </span>things and with sensual fancies coveting worldly fame and

<span id="L4473" class="LineNr"> 4473 </span>getting when it is good in its nature and does you so much
<span id="L4474" class="LineNr"> 4474 </span>good, even increasing your devotion when it is well used.
<span id="L4475" class="LineNr"> 4475 </span>In answer to this I say that there are two ways of living
<span id="L4476" class="LineNr"> 4476 </span>in the Holy Church. One is an active life; the other is
<span id="L4477" class="LineNr"> 4477 </span>a contemplative life.
<span id="L4478" class="LineNr"> 4478 </span>6. Tue active uire is the lower one, and the contemplative life is the higher one. Active life has two degrees,
<span id="L4479" class="LineNr"> 4479 </span>a higher and a lower; and the contemplative life likewise
<span id="L4480" class="LineNr"> 4480 </span>has two degrees, a lower and a higher. Also these two
<span id="L4481" class="LineNr"> 4481 </span>lives are so joined together that neither of them may be
<span id="L4482" class="LineNr"> 4482 </span>had fully without some part of the other, although they
<span id="L4483" class="LineNr"> 4483 </span>are quite different in their respective parts.
<span id="L4484" class="LineNr"> 4484 </span>
<span id="L4485" class="LineNr"> 4485 </span>7. Wuy 1s TH1s so? The reason is that the highest part
<span id="L4486" class="LineNr"> 4486 </span>of the active life is at the same time the lower part of the
<span id="L4487" class="LineNr"> 4487 </span>contemplative life. Because of this, a man cannot be considered to be living fully the active life unless he is living
<span id="L4488" class="LineNr"> 4488 </span>partly as a contemplative; and, correspondingly, a man is
<span id="L4489" class="LineNr"> 4489 </span>not living fully as a contemplative unless he lives partly
<span id="L4490" class="LineNr"> 4490 </span>an active life.
<span id="L4491" class="LineNr"> 4491 </span>8. Tue ConpiTION oF THE ACTIVE LIFE is such that
<span id="L4492" class="LineNr"> 4492 </span>it both begins and ends in this life; but that is not the case
<span id="L4493" class="LineNr"> 4493 </span>with the contemplative life. It begins in this life, but it
<span id="L4494" class="LineNr"> 4494 </span>continues thereafter without end. Why is this so? The
<span id="L4495" class="LineNr"> 4495 </span>part that Mary chose shall never be taken away. Active
<span id="L4496" class="LineNr"> 4496 </span>life is full of troubles and worries concerning many things;
<span id="L4497" class="LineNr"> 4497 </span>but the contemplative person sits in peace with one thing.
<span id="L4498" class="LineNr"> 4498 </span>9. THe Lower Part oF ACTIVE LIFE consists in good
<span id="L4499" class="LineNr"> 4499 </span>80

<span id="L4505" class="LineNr"> 4505 </span>and honest bodily works of mercy and charity. The higher
<span id="L4506" class="LineNr"> 4506 </span>part of active life and the lower part of contemplative
<span id="L4507" class="LineNr"> 4507 </span>life consist in good spiritual meditations, the earnest observing of 2 man’s own wretchedness with sorrow and
<span id="L4508" class="LineNr"> 4508 </span>contrition, considering the Passion of Christ and of His
<span id="L4509" class="LineNr"> 4509 </span>servants with pity and compassion, and considering with
<span id="L4510" class="LineNr"> 4510 </span>thanks and praise the wonderful gifts, the kindness and
<span id="L4511" class="LineNr"> 4511 </span>works of God in all His creatures physical and spiritual.
<span id="L4512" class="LineNr"> 4512 </span>But the higher part of the contemplative life, as it may
<span id="L4513" class="LineNr"> 4513 </span>be had here, takes place altogether in this darkness and in
<span id="L4514" class="LineNr"> 4514 </span>this cloud of unknowing with a loving stirring blindly
<span id="L4515" class="LineNr"> 4515 </span>beholding the naked being only of God Himself.
<span id="L4516" class="LineNr"> 4516 </span>10. Iv THE LOWER PART OF THE ACTIVE LIFE a man is
<span id="L4517" class="LineNr"> 4517 </span>without himself and beneath himself. In the higher part of
<span id="L4518" class="LineNr"> 4518 </span>the active life and in the lower part of the contemplative
<span id="L4519" class="LineNr"> 4519 </span>life, a man is within himself and even with himself. But
<span id="L4520" class="LineNr"> 4520 </span>in the higher part of the contemplative life, a man is above
<span id="L4521" class="LineNr"> 4521 </span>himself and under his God.
<span id="L4522" class="LineNr"> 4522 </span>
<span id="L4523" class="LineNr"> 4523 </span>11. Anp way 1s 17 that he is above himself? It is because he is seeking to attain by grace something that he
<span id="L4524" class="LineNr"> 4524 </span>cannot attain by his very nature, namely, to be knit to
<span id="L4525" class="LineNr"> 4525 </span>God in spirit, in unity of love, and accordance of will
<span id="L4526" class="LineNr"> 4526 </span>12. Furtwer, just as it is impossible, at least to our
<span id="L4527" class="LineNr"> 4527 </span>understanding, for a man to come to the higher part of
<span id="L4528" class="LineNr"> 4528 </span>the active life without first ceasing for a time to live on
<span id="L4529" class="LineNr"> 4529 </span>the lower part; so also a man cannot come to the higher
<span id="L4530" class="LineNr"> 4530 </span>part of the contemplative life unless he cease for a time
<span id="L4531" class="LineNr"> 4531 </span>living on the lower part.

<span id="L5331" class="LineNr"> 5331 </span>spiritual director and his conscience, he should by no

<span id="L5338" class="LineNr"> 5338 </span>contemplative life and said, “Thy sins be forgiven thee,”

<span id="L5472" class="LineNr"> 5472 </span>voice and words of His manhood, although it would be

<span id="L5487" class="LineNr"> 5487 </span>completely transported by contemplation and the love of
<span id="L5488" class="LineNr"> 5488 </span>the Godhead that there will not still remain a large and
<span id="L5489" class="LineNr"> 5489 </span>wonderful cloud of unknowing between him and his God.
<span id="L5490" class="LineNr"> 5490 </span>Ie was in this cloud that Mary was occupied, pressed by
<span id="L5491" class="LineNr"> 5491 </span>many a secret love. And why was this so? Because it was
<span id="L5492" class="LineNr"> 5492 </span>the best and holiest part of contemplation that may be
<span id="L5493" class="LineNr"> 5493 </span>possible in this life, and from this she would not move her
<span id="L5494" class="LineNr"> 5494 </span>desire for anything. In fact, when her sister Martha complained about her to our Lord and asked Him to tell her
<span id="L5495" class="LineNr"> 5495 </span>to get up and help her so that she would not have to work
<span id="L5496" class="LineNr"> 5496 </span>so hard by herself, Mary remained sitting in perfect stillness, not answering a single word and not even showing
<span id="L5497" class="LineNr"> 5497 </span>an angry gesture against her sister’s complaint. And there
<span id="L5498" class="LineNr"> 5498 </span>is no wonder in this; for Mary had another work to do
<span id="L5499" class="LineNr"> 5499 </span>that her sister knew not of. And that is why she had no

<span id="L5646" class="LineNr"> 5646 </span>the circumstances in which she made it. Her lack of knowledge was the cause of what she said. And it is no wonder,
<span id="L5647" class="LineNr"> 5647 </span>for she did not know at that time what Mary was doing.
<span id="L5648" class="LineNr"> 5648 </span>I believe that she had heard very little of such perfection

<span id="L5731" class="LineNr"> 5731 </span>as Martha asked Him to do, but as an advocate defending
<span id="L5732" class="LineNr"> 5732 </span>according to the law her who loved Him. “Martha,
<span id="L5733" class="LineNr"> 5733 </span>Martha!” He said. Twice for emphasis He spoke her
<span id="L5734" class="LineNr"> 5734 </span>name, for He wanted her to hear Him and take heed of
<span id="L5735" class="LineNr"> 5735 </span>His words. “You are very busy,” He said, “and are
<span id="L5736" class="LineNr"> 5736 </span>troubled about many things.” Those who are active persons must necessarily be busy constantly and be occupied
<span id="L5737" class="LineNr"> 5737 </span>in doing many different things, first for their own use,
<span id="L5738" class="LineNr"> 5738 </span>and then in deeds of mercy for their fellow Christians as
<span id="L5739" class="LineNr"> 5739 </span>charity requires. He said this to Martha, for He wanted
<span id="L5740" class="LineNr"> 5740 </span>her to know that the work she was doing was good and
<span id="L5741" class="LineNr"> 5741 </span>beneficial for the health of her soul; but in order that she
<span id="L5742" class="LineNr"> 5742 </span>should not think that she was engaged in the best work of
<span id="L5743" class="LineNr"> 5743 </span>all that man may do, He said further, “But one thing is
<span id="L5744" class="LineNr"> 5744 </span>necessary.”
<span id="L5745" class="LineNr"> 5745 </span>
<span id="L5746" class="LineNr"> 5746 </span>4. AND WHAT IS THAT ONE THING? Certainly that God
<span id="L5747" class="LineNr"> 5747 </span>be loved and praised of Himself above all other things
<span id="L5748" class="LineNr"> 5748 </span>physical or spiritual that man may do. And for this, in
<span id="L5749" class="LineNr"> 5749 </span>order that Martha should not think that she could both
<span id="L5750" class="LineNr"> 5750 </span>love God and praise Him above all other things physical or
<span id="L5751" class="LineNr"> 5751 </span>spiritual and be busy at the same time with the necessities
<span id="L5752" class="LineNr"> 5752 </span>of this life; and in order to free her from doubt as to
<span id="L5753" class="LineNr"> 5753 </span>whether she might not be able to serve God perfectly in
<span id="L5754" class="LineNr"> 5754 </span>both physical and spiritual affairs—imperfectly she may but
<span id="L5755" class="LineNr"> 5755 </span>not perfectly—He added that Mary had chosen the best
<span id="L5756" class="LineNr"> 5756 </span>part and that this would never be taken away from her.
<span id="L5757" class="LineNr"> 5757 </span>The reason is that this perfect stirring of love that begins
<span id="L5758" class="LineNr"> 5758 </span>here in this life is equal with that which shall last eternally

<span id="L5780" class="LineNr"> 5780 </span>
<span id="L5781" class="LineNr"> 5781 </span>good things of which Mary chose the best? There are not

<span id="L5783" class="LineNr"> 5783 </span>
<span id="L5784" class="LineNr"> 5784 </span>only of two: the active life and the contemplative life; and
<span id="L5785" class="LineNr"> 5785 </span>these two lives are expressed in a concealed way in the

<span id="L5787" class="LineNr"> 5787 </span>Martha representing the active person and Mary the contemplative one. Without one of these two lives, no one
<span id="L5788" class="LineNr"> 5788 </span>may have salvation; and where there are no more than

<span id="L5828" class="LineNr"> 5828 </span>and active life are coupled together in spiritual kinship
<span id="L5829" class="LineNr"> 5829 </span>and they are made sisters by the example of Mary and

<span id="L5832" class="LineNr"> 5832 </span>no higher except on very
<span id="L5833" class="LineNr"> 5833 </span>
<span id="L5834" class="LineNr"> 5834 </span>rare occasions, and then only by a special grace. A contemplative person may come this low toward the active

<span id="L5841" class="LineNr"> 5841 </span>this dark cloud of unknowing with many a secret love

<span id="L6022" class="LineNr"> 6022 </span>us as long as we are engaged in the struggles of this life,
<span id="L6023" class="LineNr"> 6023 </span>as they did against Mary. But I do say that if we will pay
<span id="L6024" class="LineNr"> 6024 </span>no more attention to what they are saying and what they

<span id="L6384" class="LineNr"> 6384 </span>difficult task indeed does he have who commits himself to
<span id="L6385" class="LineNr"> 6385 </span>this work. In fact, it will be exceedingly difficult unless he
<span id="L6386" class="LineNr"> 6386 </span>cither has a very special grace or he has been accustomed
<span id="L6387" class="LineNr"> 6387 </span>to the work for a long period of time.
<span id="L6388" class="LineNr"> 6388 </span>2. Now I asx you: in what does this difficult task consist? Certainly not in that devout stirring of love that is
<span id="L6389" class="LineNr"> 6389 </span>continually wrought in his will not by himself but by the
<span id="L6390" class="LineNr"> 6390 </span>hand of Almighty God; for God is always ready to bring
<span id="L6391" class="LineNr"> 6391 </span>this work to pass in each soul that is disposed to carry it
<span id="L6392" class="LineNr"> 6392 </span>out when the person does whatever is his power and has
<span id="L6393" class="LineNr"> 6393 </span>
<span id="L6394" class="LineNr"> 6394 </span>done so for a long time in order to carry on the work.
<span id="L6395" class="LineNr"> 6395 </span>
<span id="L6396" class="LineNr"> 6396 </span>3. Bur I ask you: in what does this difficult task consist? Certainly it consists in treading down the remembrance of all the creatures that God has ever made and in
<span id="L6397" class="LineNr"> 6397 </span>holding them beneath the cloud of forgetting of which
<span id="L6398" class="LineNr"> 6398 </span>we have spoken before. Alll the difficult work is contained
<span id="L6399" class="LineNr"> 6399 </span>in this, for this is man’s fundamental struggle, with the help
<span id="L6400" class="LineNr"> 6400 </span>of grace. And the other mentioned above—that is to say,
<span id="L6401" class="LineNr"> 6401 </span>the stirring of love—that is the work only of God. Go on
<span id="L6402" class="LineNr"> 6402 </span>with your work, therefore, and surely I promise you that
<span id="L6403" class="LineNr"> 6403 </span>He shall not fail in His.
<span id="L6404" class="LineNr"> 6404 </span>
<span id="L6405" class="LineNr"> 6405 </span>4. Move steaprastxy ahead then. Let us see how well
<span id="L6406" class="LineNr"> 6406 </span>you can carry yourself, Do you not see how He supports
<span id="L6407" class="LineNr"> 6407 </span>and sustain:
<span id="L6408" class="LineNr"> 6408 </span>‘or shame! Labor hard for a while, and
<span id="L6409" class="LineNr"> 6409 </span>soon you will find that the difficulty and the pressure of
<span id="L6410" class="LineNr"> 6410 </span>this strenuous work will begin to be eased. Even though it
<span id="L6411" class="LineNr"> 6411 </span>is hard and undiminished in the beginning when you have
<span id="L6412" class="LineNr"> 6412 </span>no devotion, after a while when you have acquired devowhat had been so hard for you will become much
<span id="L6413" class="LineNr"> 6413 </span>easier and much less taxing for you to do. You will then
<span id="L6414" class="LineNr"> 6414 </span>have little work, or perhaps none at all to do; for God
<span id="L6415" class="LineNr"> 6415 </span>will then work sometimes all by Himself. But that will
<span id="L6416" class="LineNr"> 6416 </span>not always be, nor will it be for a long period at a time.
<span id="L6417" class="LineNr"> 6417 </span>Ie will only be when and as He is so inclined. And then

<span id="L7084" class="LineNr"> 7084 </span>so strongly stirred by a thing of whose nature you know
<span id="L7085" class="LineNr"> 7085 </span>nothing at all. In this way, the stirring within you carries
<span id="L7086" class="LineNr"> 7086 </span>no special thought of anything under God, and thus your
<span id="L7087" class="LineNr"> 7087 </span>intent is directed purely toward God.

<span id="L7090" class="LineNr"> 7090 </span>Himself with no special devices being used, neither by
<span id="L7091" class="LineNr"> 7091 </span>Him nor by you. And have no fear, for the devil is not
<span id="L7092" class="LineNr"> 7092 </span>able to come so near. He comes to stir a man’s will only
<span id="L7093" class="LineNr"> 7093 </span>very seldom, and then from afar, no matter how clever a

<span id="L7187" class="LineNr"> 7187 </span>spoken may be compared to a mirror. Spiritually, the eyes
<span id="L7188" class="LineNr"> 7188 </span>of your soul are your reason, your consciousness is your
<span id="L7189" class="LineNr"> 7189 </span>spiritual face. And just as it is so that if you have a dirty
<span id="L7190" class="LineNr"> 7190 </span>spot on your physical face your eyes cannot see that spot
<span id="L7191" class="LineNr"> 7191 </span>nor know where it is without a mirror or someone else
<span id="L7192" class="LineNr"> 7192 </span>to tell you; so it is spiritually in the same way that without
<span id="L7193" class="LineNr"> 7193 </span>reading or hearing God's word it is not possible for a soul
<span id="L7194" class="LineNr"> 7194 </span>blinded by habitual sin to see the foul spot upon his
<span id="L7195" class="LineNr"> 7195 </span>consciousness.
<span id="L7196" class="LineNr"> 7196 </span>
<span id="L7197" class="LineNr"> 7197 </span>4. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS, when a man looks into
<span id="L7198" class="LineNr"> 7198 </span>a physical or a spiritual mirror or learns from what other
<span id="L7199" class="LineNr"> 7199 </span>men tell him where the foul spot is on his face, physically
<span id="L7200" class="LineNr"> 7200 </span>tually, he runs at once to the well to wash himself,
<span id="L7201" class="LineNr"> 7201 </span>but not before he knows where the spot is. If this spot
<span id="L7202" class="LineNr"> 7202 </span>involves a special sin, then the well is the Holy Church
<span id="L7203" class="LineNr"> 7203 </span>and the water is the confession with all its attendant circumstances. But if this spor is only a blind root and a
<span id="L7204" class="LineNr"> 7204 </span>stirring of sin, then the well is the merciful God and the
<span id="L7205" class="LineNr"> 7205 </span>water is prayer with all its circumstances. You can see
<span id="L7206" class="LineNr"> 7206 </span>from this that good thinking cannot be achieved, neither
<span id="L7207" class="LineNr"> 7207 </span>by beginner nor by advanced students, without their first
<span id="L7208" class="LineNr"> 7208 </span>reading and hearing. And, in the same way, praying cannot
<span id="L7209" class="LineNr"> 7209 </span>come before thinking.

<span id="L7874" class="LineNr"> 7874 </span>and filled with a foul stinking lump of himself that must

<span id="L8146" class="LineNr"> 8146 </span>that God is a Spirit, and that any-
<span id="L8147" class="LineNr"> 8147 </span>
<span id="L8148" class="LineNr"> 8148 </span>one who desires to be united with Him must necessarily
<span id="L8149" class="LineNr"> 8149 </span>
<span id="L8150" class="LineNr"> 8150 </span>keep himself steadfastly in depth of spirit and far from all
<span id="L8151" class="LineNr"> 8151 </span>
<span id="L8152" class="LineNr"> 8152 </span>counterfeit physical things. Surely everything is known to

<span id="L8154" class="LineNr"> 8154 </span>
<span id="L8155" class="LineNr"> 8155 </span>may be hidden from His knowledge. And since God is a
<span id="L8156" class="LineNr"> 8156 </span>
<span id="L8157" class="LineNr"> 8157 </span>Spirit, the thing that is hidden in the depth of the spirit
<span id="L8158" class="LineNr"> 8158 </span>is more openly known and shown to Him than things that
<span id="L8159" class="LineNr"> 8159 </span>are in contact with the physical in any degree. By their
<span id="L8160" class="LineNr"> 8160 </span>very nature, therefore, physical things are further from
<span id="L8161" class="LineNr"> 8161 </span>God than are spiritual things. It seems, consequently, that
<span id="L8162" class="LineNr"> 8162 </span>when our desires have physical qualities mingled with them,
<span id="L8163" class="LineNr"> 8163 </span>as they do when we stress and strain ourselves in spirit
<span id="L8164" class="LineNr"> 8164 </span>and body together, we are then further from God than
<span id="L8165" class="LineNr"> 8165 </span>we would be if we proceeded more devoutly and soberly
<span id="L8166" class="LineNr"> 8166 </span>in purity and depth of spirit.

<span id="L8170" class="LineNr"> 8170 </span>stirring of your desire. And yet I have not told you to
<span id="L8171" class="LineNr"> 8171 </span>hide it completely, for it would be the instructions of a
<span id="L8172" class="LineNr"> 8172 </span>fool to tell you to do what cannot be done. I have told
<span id="L8173" class="LineNr"> 8173 </span>you, rather, to do whatever you are able to do to hide it.
<span id="L8174" class="LineNr"> 8174 </span>‘And why have I said that? Certainly because I want you
<span id="L8175" class="LineNr"> 8175 </span>to press it deep into your spirit far from contamination
<span id="L8176" class="LineNr"> 8176 </span>with physical things, which would make it less spiritual

<span id="L8195" class="LineNr"> 8195 </span>to understand a thing in physical terms when it has been
<span id="L8196" class="LineNr"> 8196 </span>spoken spiritually that perhaps if I had told

<span id="L8520" class="LineNr"> 8520 </span>you would have thought of it in a more physical way than

<span id="L8561" class="LineNr"> 8561 </span>world to enter the school of God, he believes that when
<span id="L8562" class="LineNr"> 8562 </span>he has given himself for a little while to penance and to

<span id="L8565" class="LineNr"> 8565 </span>hears people around him speaking and reading and which

<span id="L8580" class="LineNr"> 8580 </span>with their wish to undertake the work, they begin to
<span id="L8581" class="LineNr"> 8581 </span>complain about their teachers and they think—and perhaps
<span id="L8582" class="LineNr"> 8582 </span>they even say so to others—that they cannot find anyone
<span id="L8583" class="LineNr"> 8583 </span>who really understands them. As a result of this bold and
<span id="L8584" class="LineNr"> 8584 </span>presumptuous curiosity of their minds, they discontinue
<span id="L8585" class="LineNr"> 8585 </span>their humble prayers and penance much too soon, and they

<span id="L8592" class="LineNr"> 8592 </span>foolishness and not wisdom, and it can even lead a man to

<span id="L9012" class="LineNr"> 9012 </span>and in their imagination.
<span id="L9013" class="LineNr"> 9013 </span>2. THat THIS 18 so is indicated by the following. The
<span id="L9014" class="LineNr"> 9014 </span>devil is a spirit, and of his own nature he does not have
<span id="L9015" class="LineNr"> 9015 </span>a body any more than an angel does. Nevertheless, when
<span id="L9016" class="LineNr"> 9016 </span>190
<span id="L9017" class="LineNr"> 9017 </span>
<span id="L9018" class="LineNr"> 9018 </span>he or an angel would take a body with God’s permission
<span id="L9019" class="LineNr"> 9019 </span>in order to perform some act for any man in this life, the
<span id="L9020" class="LineNr"> 9020 </span>quality of his body corresponds, at least in part, to the kind
<span id="L9021" class="LineNr"> 9021 </span>of work he is doing.
<span id="L9022" class="LineNr"> 9022 </span>3. Tue Hory Scriptures give us an example of this.
<span id="L9023" class="LineNr"> 9023 </span>
<span id="L9024" class="LineNr"> 9024 </span>In the Old Testament and in the New Testament as well,
<span id="L9025" class="LineNr"> 9025 </span>
<span id="L9026" class="LineNr"> 9026 </span>whenever an angel was sent in a bodily form, it always
<span id="L9027" class="LineNr"> 9027 </span>disclosed either by its name or by some instrument or
<span id="L9028" class="LineNr"> 9028 </span>
<span id="L9029" class="LineNr"> 9029 </span>quality of its body what its purpose or its message was in
<span id="L9030" class="LineNr"> 9030 </span>spirit. The same is true of the devil. When he appears in
<span id="L9031" class="LineNr"> 9031 </span>a body, he represents in some quality of his body what his
<span id="L9032" class="LineNr"> 9032 </span>servants are in spirit.
<span id="L9033" class="LineNr"> 9033 </span>
<span id="L9034" class="LineNr"> 9034 </span>4. A SINGLE EXAMPLE of this will take the place of
<span id="L9035" class="LineNr"> 9035 </span>many. In the case of some disciples of necromancy, those
<span id="L9036" class="LineNr"> 9036 </span>who have studied the calling up of wicked spirits and to
<span id="L9037" class="LineNr"> 9037 </span>some of whom the devil has appeared in bodily form, I
<span id="L9038" class="LineNr"> 9038 </span>have observed that the bodily form in which the devil
<span id="L9039" class="LineNr"> 9039 </span>appears always has one nostril that is both large and wide,
<span id="L9040" class="LineNr"> 9040 </span>and he will gladly open it up so that a man can look into
<span id="L9041" class="LineNr"> 9041 </span>it right up to the brain in his head. This brain is nothing
<span id="L9042" class="LineNr"> 9042 </span>else than the fire of hell, for the devil can have no other
<span id="L9043" class="LineNr"> 9043 </span>kind of brain than that. And if he can get a man to look
<span id="L9044" class="LineNr"> 9044 </span>into the fire of hell, that is all he wants; for with that one
<span id="L9045" class="LineNr"> 9045 </span>look, the man will lose his senses forever. But a trained
<span id="L9046" class="LineNr"> 9046 </span>disciple of necromancy knows this well enough, and he
<span id="L9047" class="LineNr"> 9047 </span>is therefore able to keep things in control and not provoke
<span id="L9048" class="LineNr"> 9048 </span>the devil.

<span id="L9534" class="LineNr"> 9534 </span>
<span id="L9535" class="LineNr"> 9535 </span>and particularly those who follow the work of this book
<span id="L9536" class="LineNr"> 9536 </span>must understand fully that although they read “lift up” or
<span id="L9537" class="LineNr"> 9537 </span>
<span id="L9538" class="LineNr"> 9538 </span>“go in,” and even though the work of this book is called
<span id="L9539" class="LineNr"> 9539 </span>a “stirring,” they must be constantly aware that this stir-
<span id="L9540" class="LineNr"> 9540 </span>
<span id="L9541" class="LineNr"> 9541 </span>ring reaches neither up nor in in a physical way, and that
<span id="L9542" class="LineNr"> 9542 </span>it is not the kind of stirring that moves from one place to
<span id="L9543" class="LineNr"> 9543 </span>
<span id="L9544" class="LineNr"> 9544 </span>another. Even though it is sometimes referred to as a rest,
<span id="L9545" class="LineNr"> 9545 </span>
<span id="L9546" class="LineNr"> 9546 </span>you must not think that it is the kind of rest in which you
<span id="L9547" class="LineNr"> 9547 </span>remain in one place without moving. In its perfection this
<span id="L9548" class="LineNr"> 9548 </span>work is so pure and so spiritual in itself that, when you
<span id="L9549" class="LineNr"> 9549 </span>conceive it correctly,
<span id="L9550" class="LineNr"> 9550 </span>
<span id="L9551" class="LineNr"> 9551 </span>you can easily see that it involves
<span id="L9552" class="LineNr"> 9552 </span>
<span id="L9553" class="LineNr"> 9553 </span>something altogether different from a physical stirring or
<span id="L9554" class="LineNr"> 9554 </span>from a physical place.
<span id="L9555" class="LineNr"> 9555 </span>4. It woutp Be MUCH BETTER to refer to it as a sudden changing than as a stirring, or moving, of place. Time,
<span id="L9556" class="LineNr"> 9556 </span>place, and body:
<span id="L9557" class="LineNr"> 9557 </span>these three should be forgotten in all
<span id="L9558" class="LineNr"> 9558 </span>spiritual work. Be very careful in this work, therefore, and
<span id="L9559" class="LineNr"> 9559 </span>be sure not to take as your example the physical ascension
<span id="L9560" class="LineNr"> 9560 </span>of Christ so that you strain
<span id="L9561" class="LineNr"> 9561 </span>your imagination when you
<span id="L9562" class="LineNr"> 9562 </span>pray, trying to move upward physically as though you
<span id="L9563" class="LineNr"> 9563 </span>were trying to climb over the moon.

<span id="L9611" class="LineNr"> 9611 </span>seems to you that you have ample evidence that heaven is
<span id="L9612" class="LineNr"> 9612 </span>upward. Certainly Christ ascended into the air upward
<span id="L9613" class="LineNr"> 9613 </span>physically, and He sent the Holy Ghost as He had promised, coming from above physically, and all His disciples
<span id="L9614" class="LineNr"> 9614 </span>saw it. This is our belief. You think, therefore, that since
<span id="L9615" class="LineNr"> 9615 </span>you have this evidence, why should you not direct your
<span id="L9616" class="LineNr"> 9616 </span>mind upward physically when you pray.
<span id="L9617" class="LineNr"> 9617 </span>2. To ras I witt answer as humbly as I can as follows. Since it was so that Christ did ascend physically and
<span id="L9618" class="LineNr"> 9618 </span>then sent the Holy Ghost physically, it was only proper
<span id="L9619" class="LineNr"> 9619 </span>that it be upward and from above rather than downward
<span id="L9620" class="LineNr"> 9620 </span>and from underneath, or behind, or before, or on one side
<span id="L9621" class="LineNr"> 9621 </span>or the other. Apart from this, however, He had no more

<span id="L9808" class="LineNr"> 9808 </span>of this that man, who is the best-looking creature that God

<span id="L9812" class="LineNr"> 9812 </span>
<span id="L9813" class="LineNr"> 9813 </span>heaven. And why is this so? In order to represent in physical form
<span id="L9814" class="LineNr"> 9814 </span>
<span id="L9815" class="LineNr"> 9815 </span>the spiritual work
<span id="L9816" class="LineNr"> 9816 </span>

<span id="L9829" class="LineNr"> 9829 </span>spoken in physical words such as up or down, in or out,

<span id="L9833" class="LineNr"> 9833 </span>with physical words, since speech is a work of the body

<span id="L9985" class="LineNr"> 9985 </span>, are two working powers, and Imagination and
<span id="L9986" class="LineNr"> 9986 </span>Sensuality are two more. Alll these four powers and their

<span id="L10004" class="LineNr">10004 </span>Sensuality are classed as secondary because they work in

<span id="L10523" class="LineNr">10523 </span>feel is so great and because they miss their pleasures, they
<span id="L10524" class="LineNr">10524 </span>let their attention return to physical things. Then they

<span id="L10530" class="LineNr">10530 </span>base and pain of the original sin. Sometimes it seems to

<span id="L10671" class="LineNr">10671 </span>Truly, whoever will read Denis’ books will find that tis

<span id="L10678" class="LineNr">10678 </span>the words of authorities. Now, however, that has tummed
<span id="L10679" class="LineNr">10679 </span>into artfulness and the display of knowledge. You have
<span id="L10680" class="LineNr">10680 </span>no need of that, and therefore I do not do it. Whoever
<span id="L10681" class="LineNr">10681 </span>has ears, let him hear; and whoever is stirred to believe,

<span id="L10696" class="LineNr">10696 </span>say that it all depends on the decree and the disposition
<span id="L10697" class="LineNr">10697 </span>of God. This grace of contemplation and spiritual work
<span id="L10698" class="LineNr">10698 </span>is given according to the capacity of the soul.
<span id="L10699" class="LineNr">10699 </span>2, THere are some who cannot achieve it without great

<span id="L10746" class="LineNr">10746 </span>The reason is that this grace of contemplation is symbolized by the ark of the covenant in the Old Testament,
<span id="L10747" class="LineNr">10747 </span>and those who worked in this grace are represented by
<span id="L10748" class="LineNr">10748 </span>those who mingled most around the ark, as the story
<span id="L10749" class="LineNr">10749 </span>indicates. It is quite appropriate to compare this grace and
<span id="L10750" class="LineNr">10750 </span>this work to that ark, for just as all the jewels and relics
<span id="L10751" class="LineNr">10751 </span>of the Temple were contained in that ark so also are all

<span id="L10761" class="LineNr">10761 </span>and then only with a great and long labor, Aaron had it
<span id="L10762" class="LineNr">10762 </span>in his power because of his office to see it in the Temple

<span id="L10771" class="LineNr">10771 </span>long and difficult labor up to the top of the mountain.
<span id="L10772" class="LineNr">10772 </span>He had to remain there, struggling in the cloud for six

<span id="L10853" class="LineNr">10853 </span>they wish. That would be very good, but he surely should

<span id="L10934" class="LineNr">10934 </span>how it was to be made. Bezaleel constructed it and made
<span id="L10935" class="LineNr">10935 </span>

<span id="L10938" class="LineNr">10938 </span>on the mountain. And Aaron was in charge of it in the

<span id="L10944" class="LineNr">10944 </span>only very seldom despite all the climbing and struggle he
<span id="L10945" class="LineNr">10945 </span>endured to reach the mount. And even then, when it was

<span id="L10949" class="LineNr">10949 </span>
<span id="L10950" class="LineNr">10950 </span>it foolishly and without learning and I know that I am a

<span id="L10952" class="LineNr">10952 </span>of Bezaleel. That function is to make the spiritual ark, and

<span id="L10954" class="LineNr">10954 </span>to describe its nature and the making of it in terms of the

<span id="L10956" class="LineNr">10956 </span>use of your hands. But your work can be much better and
<span id="L10957" class="LineNr">10957 </span>of much greater value than mine if you will be as Aaron;
<span id="L10958" class="LineNr">10958 </span>that is, if you will continually work in this for yourself
<span id="L10959" class="LineNr">10959 </span>and for me. Do this, I pray of you, for the love of God

<span id="L10961" class="LineNr">10961 </span>to carry on this work, I implore you for the love of God

<span id="L11021" class="LineNr">11021 </span>writing with my limited knowledge. That was my intention. Read it over, therefore, twice or three times, the
<span id="L11022" class="LineNr">11022 </span>more often the better, for you will then understand it more
<span id="L11023" class="LineNr">11023 </span>fully. It may be, in fact, that if there was a sentence that

<span id="L11037" class="LineNr">11037 </span>men should do this work and when they should undertake
<span id="L11038" class="LineNr">11038 </span>it. And if you let any such men see it, then I beg of

<span id="L11161" class="LineNr">11161 </span>are several reasons for which the actual feeling of the work
<span id="L11162" class="LineNr">11162 </span>
<span id="L11163" class="LineNr">11163 </span>may often be withdrawn from young spiritual disciples.

<span id="L11165" class="LineNr">11165 </span>Sometimes it is withdrawn so that he shall not treat it

<span id="L11167" class="LineNr">11167 </span>presumptuously and believe that it is largely in his own
<span id="L11168" class="LineNr">11168 </span>
<span id="L11169" class="LineNr">11169 </span>power to have it when he desires and as he desires. Such a
<span id="L11170" class="LineNr">11170 </span>belief is pride, and whenever the feeling of grace is with-
<span id="L11171" class="LineNr">11171 </span>
<span id="L11172" class="LineNr">11172 </span>drawn, pride is the cause. That is to say, it is not because
<span id="L11173" class="LineNr">11173 </span>
<span id="L11174" class="LineNr">11174 </span>of pride he has actually
<span id="L11175" class="LineNr">11175 </span>
<span id="L11176" class="LineNr">11176 </span>had in the past, but because of the
<span id="L11177" class="LineNr">11177 </span>
<span id="L11178" class="LineNr">11178 </span>pride he would have if this feeling of grace were not withdrawn. Thus it is often the case that young fools think
<span id="L11179" class="LineNr">11179 </span>that God is their enemy, when He is completely their
<span id="L11180" class="LineNr">11180 </span>friend.

<span id="L11201" class="LineNr">11201 </span>
<span id="L11202" class="LineNr">11202 </span>more joy in finding it than he had sorrow when he lost it.

<span id="L11204" class="LineNr">11204 </span>with no mistake that he is called by God to practice this

<span id="L11209" class="LineNr">11209 </span>desires grow by delays, and if they are diminished by
<span id="L11210" class="LineNr">11210 </span>delays, they were never holy desires. If a man feels less
<span id="L11211" class="LineNr">11211 </span>and less joy in new discoveries and in the unexpected fulfillment of old desires he had had in the past, then, even
<span id="L11212" class="LineNr">11212 </span>though they may have been natural desires seeking the
<span id="L11213" class="LineNr">11213 </span>good, they were never holy desires. Saint Austin spoke of
<span id="L11214" class="LineNr">11214 </span>such a holy desire when he said that the entire life of a
