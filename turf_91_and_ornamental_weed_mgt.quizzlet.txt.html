<span id="L21" class="LineNr"> 21 </span>(How weeds Spread)
<span id="L22" class="LineNr"> 22 </span>Weeds spread when seeds or growing plant parts (stems, roots, rhizomes) are moved or carried into new territory. Some invading weed species have evolved special seed shapes or structures to aid their movement by wind, water, or animals. Also many plants have vegetative parts the resprout new roots or shoots. If these plant fragments are carried into new areas, they may grow and start new infestations.
<span id="L23" class="LineNr"> 23 </span>
<span id="L24" class="LineNr"> 24 </span>
<span id="L25" class="LineNr"> 25 </span>Wind (How weeds Spread)
<span id="L26" class="LineNr"> 26 </span>carries many seeds to new areas. Some weedsm such as dandelions, have a parachute like attachment that carries the seed in the wind. For other weeds such as kochia, Russian thistle, and some mustards, the entire plant moves or tumbles with the wind, dropping seeds as it rolls.
<span id="L27" class="LineNr"> 27 </span>
<span id="L28" class="LineNr"> 28 </span>
<span id="L29" class="LineNr"> 29 </span>Water (How weeds Spread)
<span id="L30" class="LineNr"> 30 </span>From rain or irrigation and surface runoff also transports many seeds. Some seeds have an oily coating or an air bladder to aid flotation. Rivers, streams, and irrigation canals move large numbers of seeds.

<span id="L32" class="LineNr"> 32 </span>
<span id="L33" class="LineNr"> 33 </span>Mammals, Birds and Humans (How weeds Spread)
<span id="L34" class="LineNr"> 34 </span>Carry seeds on their bodies, dropping them into new areas. Plants have seed shapes (BURS, HOOKS, BARBS) that cling to feathers, hair and clothing. Wild or domestic animals ingest and excrete some seeds that survive and germinate after passing through an animal's digestive tract.

<span id="L36" class="LineNr"> 36 </span>
<span id="L37" class="LineNr"> 37 </span>Weed Seed Dissemination
<span id="L38" class="LineNr"> 38 </span>People unintentionally move and introduce weeds over long distances. Equipment (for example, work trucks, cultivators, mowers, recreational equipment and automobiles) carries seeds to new sites. Some weeds develop from seeds introduced in contaminated topsoil, manure, compost, mulch, turfgrass seed or sod.

<span id="L41" class="LineNr"> 41 </span>Weed Establishment and Persistence
<span id="L42" class="LineNr"> 42 </span>Weeds rapidly become problems in ornamental beds and turf where the grounds is disturbed or where plants are weakened, such as construction areas, heavy foot traffic areas, scalped turf, or edges of plantings. Weeds do not compete well in healthy, vigorously growin turf or ornamental plantings, or where desirable plants shade the soil. Once established, weeds produce large numbers of seed, ensuring their survival.
<span id="L43" class="LineNr"> 43 </span>Weed seeds, depending on the species, can remain dormant in the soil from a period of a few months to many decades. This long seed viability helps guarantee weed survival. Because weeds can produce high numbers of seed and many weed seeds can survive in the soil for years, weed managment must be planned and carried out for years.

<span id="L48" class="LineNr"> 48 </span>
<span id="L49" class="LineNr"> 49 </span>
<span id="L50" class="LineNr"> 50 </span>Grasses
<span id="L51" class="LineNr"> 51 </span>Have only one seed leaf. Leaves are narrow and upright. Leaf veins run parallel to leaf margins. Most grasses have fine and branching (fiborous roots). SEDGES differ from grasses in that they often have triangular shapes stems rather than round or obal ones, and the leaves extend in three directions. CRABGRASS, QUACKGRASS, AND BARNYARDGRASS are typically weedy grasses. Yellow nutsedge is an example of a sedge that is found in washington.

<span id="L53" class="LineNr"> 53 </span>
<span id="L54" class="LineNr"> 54 </span>Broadleaf
<span id="L55" class="LineNr"> 55 </span>Plants, trees, and shrubs have two seed leaves. Leaves are generally broad with netlike veins. The root system is course, often with a strong taproot. Plants may be herbaceous ( no woody tissue; die back to ground) or woody (shrubs and trees). Dandelion, knotweed, and plantain are typical herbaceous broadleaf weeds. Shrubs have several stems and rarely grow taller than 10 ft; blackberries are common woody weeds. Trees usually have a single stem (trunk) abd generally grow taller than 10 feets: willows and alder are typical weed trees.
