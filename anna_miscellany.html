<p>If you made it this far, congratulationns.<br />
The Research coordinator job will have stiff competition.<br />
<br />

<a href="https://resumecat.com/career/clinical-research-coordinator/skills">12 Clinical Research Coordinator Skills"</a><br />
<br />
I'd suggest reading as much of the material  <br />
as possible to enhance your technical depth  <br />
for interview.<br /
<br />
Keywords to include in resume, in case <br />
they use computer screeners::<br />
<br />
neuroscience<br />
learning<br />
cognition<br />
Alzheimer's<br />
engrams<br />
gerontology<br />
neuropsychometric<br />
counselling<br />
patient<br />
empathetic<br />
counselling<br />
You can probably add some better terms<br />
<br />
As you probably already know, the best resumes 
echo back the essence of the job posting.<br />
Pay particular attention to any questionnaire <br />
created by Department, NOT HR<br />

<p>Your Psychology Degree distinguishes you from <br />
the competition, largely Neuroscience grads.<br />
They are S.T.E.M. technicians whereas <br />
your Psychology background distinguishes you <br />
as an empathetic, people-oriented problem solver.<br />
A smart manager knows a Research Coordinator <br />
gets things done by knowing about people.<br />

Let me know if you need anything.<br />
<br />
Best, <br />
Gordon <br />

<p>P.S.:  I started following Picower Institute <br />
because of its work on explaining engrams.  <br />
Then I learned Dr Tsai became committed to finding <br />
a cure for Alzheimer's becaus of her grandmother.<br />
<br />
But just recently I learned Picower has a dark history<br />
involving one of the biggest fraudster in American history, <br />

Bernie Madoff, and an associate/philanthropist<br />
 
named Jeffry Picower, who gave $10 million to start <br />
the Institute. Prosecutors suspect Picower's donation <br />
came from Madoff's fraud and want to recover the money. <br />
Picower committed suicide.<br />
