MARK SPILKA*
On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief:
A Psycho-Literary Speculation
Four times during the conception, writing, and pu
the Lighthouse Virginia Woolf expressed in her diaries
book's sentimentality. Thus, on Monday, July 20, 1925
the actual writing had begun, she was arming herse
hazard:
The word &quot; sentimental&quot; sticks in my gizzard (I'l
out of me in a story—Ann Watkins of New York is
on Wednesday to enquire about my stories). But thi
may be sentimental; father and mother and child in
den; the death; the sail to the Lighthouse. I think, t
that when I begin it I shall enrich it in all sorts of w

It might contain all characters boiled down; and chi
and then this impersonal thing, which I'm dared
my friends, the flight of time and the consequent
unity in my design. That passage . . . interests
much. A new problem like that breaks fresh groun
mind; prevents the regular ruts.1
Diffusely anxious in this entry, she offers three solu
mentality where one might do: she will expel it from
writing another story, a kind of purging of emoti
possess her; she will master it, in the novel itself, by en
ening, getting into the essentials of characterization and
the method which I. A. Richards prescribes, in Practic
actualizing and disinfecting charged material by workin
living context;2 and, finally, she will overcome it by
ment—an impersonal passage on the flight of time—-as
exercise of this kind might dissolve its potency or
through distancing and novelty.

The second entry, on Sunday, September 5, 1926, comes near the
end of the writing process:
The lyric portions of To the Lighthouse are collected in the
10-year lapse and don't interfere with the text so much as
usual. I feel as if it fetched its circle pretty completely this
time; and I don't feel sure what the stock criticism will be.
Sentimental? Victorian? (WD 100)
As the passage indicates, her old lyric manner now seems suspect; she
has tried to confine it to the impersonal &quot; Time Passes &quot; section, as if
by lyric uplift alone she might overshoot the sentimental hazards of the
deaths she here by-passes, or at least might isolate them from the pre
ceding and concluding sections which she identifies, interestingly, as
&quot; the text.&quot; By the fourth entry she will have even more severe doubts
about this middle section. Meanwhile she is still diffusely afraid of
being charged with Victorianism, or sentimentality, in dealing at all
with the emotions of family life and childhood. Thus, a week later,
on Monday, September 13, 1926, she repeats her dread of the theme
itself:
And this last lap, in the boat, is hard, because the material is
not so rich as it was with Lily on the lawn. I am forced
to be more direct and more intense. I am making more use of
symbolism, I observe; and I go in dread of &quot; sentimentality
Is the whole theme open to that charge? But I doubt that any
theme is in itself good or bad. It gives a chance to one's pecul
iar qualities—that's all. (WD 101)
The confession that she has not been so direct and intense with the
richer material of Lily's liberating grief on the lawn, which enables
her to complete her painting and have her &quot; vision,&quot; is matter for our
theme, if not hers: she has been avoiding the emotional hazards of her
material by indirections when it is rich, by symbolism when it thins out
and forces more direct confrontation. Her &quot; peculiar qualities,&quot; her
romantic soarings and polite evasions, continue to be as Victorian as
she fears, though passed off here as the personal side of her impersonal
artistry.
The fourth entry, on May 5, 1927, moves from the exultation of
publication and sales to the old fear of reviewers:
Book out. We have sold (I think) 1690 before publica
tion—twice Dalloway. I write however in the shadow of the
damp cloud of The Times Lit. Sup. review, which is an exact
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 3
copy of the J. s R., Mrs. Dalloway review, gentlemanly,
kindly, timid, praising beauty, doubting character, and leav
ing me moderately depressed. I am anxious about &quot; Time
Passes.&quot; Think the whole thing may be pronounced soft, shal
low, insipid, sentimental. Yet, honestly, I don't much care;
want to be let alone to ruminate. (WD 107)
she has been given the Victorian treatment by the Times Literary
Supplement and, understandably, it rankles—enough so to move her to
confess her fear that the &quot; Time Passes&quot; section, designed to avoid
sentimentality through impersonalism, is in fact a soft, insipid, shallow
specimen of that dread disease. And yet on Friday, January 14, 1927, on
revising the completed manuscript for her husband Leonard to read,
she had felt that it was &quot; a hard muscular book &quot;—that it had &quot; not run
out and gone flabby &quot;—&quot; which at this age proves that I have some
thing in me&quot; (WD 103).
Hard, muscular, unnabby. Was she as tough now as her mountain
climbing father, on whose character the book was originally supposed
to center? Or was she as soft, insipid, and shallow as he sometimes saw
her mother? One is reminded here of the somewhat different opposi
tion in Mrs. Dalloway between &quot; civilised &quot; and &quot; sentimental,&quot; those
verbal touchstones which Peter Walsh bequeaths to Clarissa as daily
guardians in a hostile world. Walsh probably derived those touch
stones, along with other qualities (his obtuseness to the feelings of
others, his unwarranted rages and emotional outpourings, his analytic
probings and impossible demands), from that late-Victorian gentleman,
Leslie Stephen, who also (whatever his own brutal rages) believed in
civilized conduct in a godless world, and who also (whatever his own
outpourings) &quot; had no use for optimism, cant, gush, enthusiasm.&quot; 3 But
Virginia Woolf had acquired her own &quot; civilised &quot; qualities—restraint,
sympathy, unselfishness—from her hostessing years for her Victorian
father,4 and plainly she had absorbed his relatively dry brand of skepti
cism at an early age. Did she come armed, then, with his masculine

weapons—hard impersonal muscular analytic artistry—as well as their
civilized feminine complement—restraint, sympathy, unselfishness—in
facing up to the dread sentimentality, the overwhelming feelings and
the shameful things they shielded, of her own childhood attachments to
both parents? Certainly the writing of this book would release her for
a time, as we know, from her obsessive daily dealings with those
watchful spectres (WD 138, MB 80). But would it wholly free her
from things hidden by their sentimental shrouds?
We can see from her own childhood recollections why her release
was only partial, if much-needed and courageously achieved. Her
portraits of her parents in Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay are as significant in
their evasions and exclusions as in their confrontations. Indeed, the
scene itself is not the Cornwall coastal town of her childhood, St.
Ives, but the Isle of Skye in western Scotland, which she would not
even visit until the summer of 1938, over ten years after completing the
novel. The size of the Ramsay family is the same as her own, two
parents and eight children, four boys and four girls: but they are
children by the same two parents! The whole Victorian menage of
children from three families—Leslie Stephen's retarded Laura from his
first marriage to Minnie Thackeray; Julia Stephen's Stella, George, and
Gerald from her first marriage to Herbert Duckworth; and Julia and
Leslie's Vanessa, Thoby, Virginia, and Adrian from their own mar
riage—has been sacrificed for the sake of artistic economy; and by that
strategic sacrifice the whole hothouse problem of predatory trifling by
the Duckworth boys with their young half-sisters, with its lifelong
damage to Virginia, has been avoided. So too has the source of Mrs.
Ramsay's stoic atheism—her brave searching radiance in the face of
suffering, death, the poor, unhappiness, treachery, unreason, disorder,
injustice. Unlike Julia Stephen, she has no personal tragedy, no &quot; per
fect &quot; first marriage ending in a husband's sudden death, no eight years
of widowhood with three young children, to explain &quot; the sternness at
the heart of her beauty &quot; which her fictive husband notes, and that
saddening &quot; remoteness&quot; from himself and others which makes him
feel unable to &quot;protect her.&quot; 5 Then too, by leaving out the details of
her mother's death, of her own subsequent breakdown, and of Stella
Duckworth's death soon after, the funereal gloom and emotional dis
tress which possessed and repossessed the family in &quot; the 10-year lapse &quot;
5 To the Lighthouse (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company, 1927),
Hereafter TTL in the text.
On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief 5
is lost, and with it the substantiality and force of Leslie Stephen s most
outlandish rages, his constant demands upon his daughters for attention
and sympathy, and their own outraged sufferance of his tyranny.
Would the novel be improved by the inclusion of such family dis
asters? Or would their empirical densities and progressions produce a
different kind of fiction? Certainly when Virginia Woolf turned to
them in her most popular novel, The Years (1937), she produced a
hopeless melange of family complications, a historical dreamfloat of
lyric impressions and &quot; cotton wool&quot; realities, as she would later call
them (MB 70). Of course, the material itself did not insure artistic
success; and in any case she had legitimately chosen, in To the Light
house, to convey the essence rather than the substance of Victorian
ism, and did so with moving power. Still, the novel's depth as an elegy,
its poignance as a grieving, its cathartic force as a release from child
hood suffering, might have been increased by some Active coping with
these terrible events; some of its disguises and effusions might have
been avoided; and its more dubious borrowings from the author's life
might have been paid for in good fictive coin.
Consider in this light the odd placement of the artist, Lily Briscoe,
whom Woolf modelled nominally upon her sister Vanessa but more
substantially upon herself. Lily is 33 as the novel opens in mid-Sep
tember, shortly before the first World War—a year or so older than
Virginia was in the fall of 1913. She is cast as a friend of the Ramsay
family, and in that sense, as &quot; one of the family but her reactions to
Mrs. Ramsay are those of an actual daughter. It is Lily, for instance,
who grieves openly for Mrs. Ramsay near the novel's close, some ten
years after her death—which would be in 1924, about the time Virginia
Woolf conceived this novel. A spinster lady who likes to paint, who
seems repelled by the very sexuality which attracts her, and who stead
fastly resists Mrs. Ramsay's urgings that she should marry, she is—like
the other characters—&quot; boiled down &quot; to such reactions. There is no
attempt to account for them by the kind of sexual trifling the author
endured in childhood and again in young adulthood; nor by the double
messages about men and marriage which she then received, and which
are here reduced to a social issue without much psychological depth.
They receive no emotional reinforcement, moreover, from Mrs. Ram
say's death, as they obviously did for Virginia Woolf, for the imme
diate impact of that death is whisked away by &quot; the flight of time.&quot;
The only other appropriate character who might have received that
impact is the youngest daughter, Cam, who is seven when the novel
6 Mark Spilka
begins. Virginia Woolf was about that age when she was manually
violated by her 18-year-old half-brother, Gerald Duckworth, and so
derived her lifelong sense of bodily shame (MB 67-69). Cam, more
fortunately, is frightened only by a boar's skull at night, an uncle's gift
which the children have nailed to the bedroom wall, over which her com
forting mother throws a disguising shawl and around which she weaves
beautiful images—&quot; it was like a bird's nest; it was like a beautiful
mountain . . . with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds
singing and little goats and antelopes and . . . everything lovely&quot;
(TTL 172)—until she gradually falls asleep. There is some poignance
here in the greater sternness of Julia Stephen's last words to Virginia,
which one of these phrases echoes: &quot; Hold yourself straight, my little
Goat&quot; (MB 84)—as if it were up to her to meet boars bravely, with
out maternal comfort, in the years to come. Cam is more swathingly
protected, then, against the &quot; great horns &quot; of approaching death, and
perhaps also of defiling sexuality; she feels no need to grieve, some ten
years later, when she takes the trip to the Lighthouse with her father
and is preoccupied instead with his death-defying ways. But Virginia
Woolf did feel the need to grieve, and through Lily Briscoe (to whom
she gives no psychic history) she tried to meet it bravely enough for
most human purposes, in her own belated way—the way of thera
peutic elegy—but with all the main chords muted.
Or perhaps all but one. The &quot; centrahty&quot; of Mrs. Ramsay, her
&quot; general presence &quot; as the center of family life, is very much th
novel's subject. As noted, Virginia Woolf's initial impulse had been to
center the book on her father's character; but her governing image of
him &quot; sitting in a boat, reciting We perished, each alone, while he
crushes a dying mackerel&quot; (WD 77), threatened to reduce his stoi
posing to sentimental viciousness by the novel's end. She would none
theless &quot; have father's character done complete &quot; in the novel, and al
most as an after-thought, &quot;mother's&quot; (WD 76). The case for her
greater concern with her father is an old one, much abetted by Quentin
Bell's recent biography, with its early account of Virginia jumpin
about naked in the bathroom with her sister Vanessa, asking her which
parent she liked best, and, when Vanessa promptly said her mother,
deciding &quot;after much delay and deliberation . . . that she preferred
her father &quot; (QB I, 26). One gains the impression from this unexamined
anecdote that Vanessa's forthright answer must have stopped Virgini
cold. In her self-defeating childhood lottery, her father was the only
parent left to prefer; as indeed he was when he outlived her mother an
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 7
her delayed (and perhaps unwanted) preference was further overlaid
by circumstance. She would of course emulate him in her career,
especially in her critical writing, and as we have just speculated, in her
desire for tough unsentimental muscular effects in her fiction. But
the strength to emulate him came, as I hope now to show, from Julia
Stephen, and the awareness of his tyrannical nature came from Julia
too, as did the ability to love him whenever he showed himself capable
of loving anyone else except his mackerel-crushing self.
It was to Julia Stephen, then, that Virginia turned in the actual writ
ing of the novel, giving her the inner fullness she could not imagine
for her father, endowing her character rather than his with mystery,
richness, creativity, and making her empathetic desire to send presents
to the Lighthouse the novel's moving impulse. Her prototype, Mrs.
Ramsay, has more interiority and more substance than any other char
acter, including the appreciative and critical Miss Briscoe who must
learn to grieve her before she can &quot; want&quot; Mr. Ramsay as the novel
ends. It is Mrs. Ramsay, Lily thinks, who holds the secret of life, in
whose mind and heart &quot; tablets bearing sacred inscriptions &quot; might be
found which &quot;would teach one everything&quot; (TTL 78-79); it is she
whom Lily must learn to love if she too is to have her vision of &quot; life
itself.&quot;
Interestingly, Mrs. Ramsay does not stand in any fundamental oppo
sition to her husband as to the nature of life, as some critics hold, but
only in how to respond to it. Both husband and wife are stoic pes
simists and stalwart copers with a godless world. If anything, she is
more pessimistic than he in wanting to keep the children locked into
the happy childhood world she makes for them and so denying the
bleak future he cheerfully accepts (TTL 91). But where Ramsay sees
himself as the failed but heroic leader of brave expeditions, the bold
confronter of grim realities about which he is basically optimistic, she
sees herself as a fount of supportive sympathy and reassurance, of em
pathetic appreciation and renewal, in a world of constantly impending
tragedy. They need one another, moreover, if they are to fulfill their
chosen roles; they depend on one another, in loving if excessive ways,
to insure their complementary functions; and their intimacy is so great
they sometimes &quot; read &quot; one another by their inverse meanings. Thus,
if Ramsay is a draining and demanding egotist, and his wife is vain and
self-destructive in her unselfish giving, she nevertheless depends on him
as much for his grim reproofs to her pessimism (e.g. TTL 184) as he
depends on her for sympathy as a fallen hero. The question, however,
8 Mark Spilka
is not so much how they relate to each other, or even how they fare
in their own lives, but what they have to give to their children—the
heritage of the past which may be salvaged from their complementary
natures as stranded voyagers. And here Mrs. Ramsay-—who is emotion
ally and socially creative where he is merely effective in academi
circles, a climber of mental mountains, a master of the philosophic
alphabet up to the letter R—plainly has the most to offer.
At that point in the novel where Lily sits with her head in Mrs.
Ramsay's lap, her arms around her knees, and wants above all unity,
intimacy, oneness with this adored guardian of life's secret wisdom, we
see the maternal sources of Mrs. Ramsay's power (TTL 78-79). The
selfless oneness she promises is like that maternal sharing of the world'
surrounding richness by which every life is or should be launched. It
is like that feeling of &quot; lying in a grape and seeing through a film of
semi-transparent yellow &quot; (MB 65) which Virginia Woolf so cherished
in her childhood; a feeling then of womblike security and selfless rap
ture by which selfhood is initially nourished, and from which it may
then develop toward confident independent being. The characters who
come to Mrs. Ramsay for this enveloping maternal reassurance range
from the eight children who deserve it as their birthright to the full
complement of adult admirers who renew their sense of themselves at
her nurturing fount. Only a few of these adult characters—Augustus
Carmichael, William Bankes, and perhaps in retrospect, Lily Briscoe—
partake of these healing waters with anything like consistent recipro
city and selfless exchange: for Mrs. Ramsay has few equals. Her child
ren as indicated have the right to her renewing reassurances without
equal return; but her husband, whose constant demands for sympathy
and replenishment epitomize the usual adult tribute to her powers, does
not. This is the problem with which the novel opens and which,
think, it never wholly solves.
The youngest child, James, wants to go to the Lighthouse on the
following day, a wondrous expedition to which he has looked forward
&quot; for years and years, it seemed &quot; (TTL 9). His mother says &quot; Yes, of
course, if it's fine tomorrow.&quot; His father says &quot; it won't be fine.&quot;
James then wants to kill his father with an axe or poker:
Such were the extremes of emotion that Mr. Ramsay excited
in his children's breasts by his mere presence; standing, as
now, lean as a knife, narrow as the blade of one, grinning sar
castically, not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son
On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief 9
and casting ridicule upon his wife, who was ten thousand
times better in every way than he was (James thought), but
also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judg
ment. (TTL 10)
As the passage makes clear, the problem is not what Mr. Ramsay
says, but how and why he says it. He is delivering a judgment which
redounds to his own credit and which, by his whole manner of deliv
ery, discredits others. He is the academic critic par excellence, and in
the nominally digressive action which shortly follows, in which Mrs.
Ramsay takes his admiring and parodic disciple, Charles Tansley, on
an errand of charity in town, the point is underscored by her memory
of the children's complaint, that Tansley turns everything interesting
they talk about into something which reflects well upon himself and
disparages them (TTL 16). The question, then, is not about the
weather, or the true nature of things, though Mrs. Ramsay does hold
out (at least nominally) for better weather, but about how to take life's
grim realities. Still, there is a parental point at stake in Mr. Ramsay's
nastiness:
What he said was true. It was always true. He was incapable
of untruth; never tampered with a fact; never altered a dis
agreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any
mortal being, least of all his own children, who, sprung from
his loins, should be aware from childhood that life is difficult;
facts uncompromising; and the passage to that fabled land
where our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail barks
founder in darkness (here Mr. Ramsay would straighten his
back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon), one
that needs, above all, courage, truth, and the power to endure.
CTTL 10-11)
The parental aim is sensible enough, and Mrs. Ramsay even agrees
with it, if we may apply to her Julia Stephen's final words to Vir
ginia: &quot; Hold yourself straight, my little Goat.&quot; But &quot; my little Goat &quot;
makes all the difference. What Ramsey wants—minus the way he
wants it—is valid; but he has left out certain preparatory steps in
striking his heroic pose, and certain truths about himself. First of all,
his wife has to keep from him her worries about household finances
and other daily problems, and her own adverse feelings about his work,
for these are &quot; homely truths &quot; he cannot face without breaking into
senseless rages (TTL 62). Secondly, and most importantly, he himself
10 MARK SPILKA
requires emotional reassurance from his wife of a childlike order so
as to overcome his sense of failure; and so we get the famous scene in
which Mrs. Ramsay becomes &quot; the fountain and spray of life,&quot; of &quot; deli
cious fecundity,&quot; into which he plunges his sterile brass male beak,
demanding and receiving the sympathy by which his vanity, his &quot; satis
faction in his own splendour,&quot; is effectively restored, and becoming
then &quot; like a child who &quot;—filled by maternal succor—&quot; drops off satis
fied &quot; (TTL 48, 58-60). The satiric line is plain, and for the most part
highly effective, but it is not quite adequate to the situation: for we all
require some such reassurance, and Ramsay's problem is not that he
wants it so badly but that he allows none to others and gives back very
little, and not very often, in return. Mrs. Ramsay, for her part, gives
too often and too much and is slowly sapped of her fecund strength.
Meanwhile her amazing resources, her radiant generosities, are
movingly conveyed. She is concerned not only with her son's feelings,
his immediate and long-range emotional needs, but with those of the
Lighthouse keeper's tubercular son, for whom she is knitting hairy
reddish brown stockings, and for the keeper himself, into whose daily
boredom she thinks her way, and for whom she will find &quot; a pile of
old magazines, and some tobacco, indeed, whatever she could find
lying about
For how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a
time, and possibly more in stormy weather, upon a rock the
size of a tennis lawn? she would ask; and to have no letters
or newspapers, and to see nobody; if you were married
not to see your wife, not to know how your children
were,—if they were ill, if they had fallen down and
broken their legs or arms; to see the same dreary waves break
ing week after week, and then a dreadful storm coming, and
the windows covered with spray, and the birds dashed against
the lamp, and the whole place rocking, and not be able to
put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the
sea? How would you like that? she asked, addressing herself
particularly to her daughters. So she added, rather differently,
one must take them whatever comforts one can. (TTL 11-12)
At least one of her daughters, given the accents of Julia Stephen at
work in this passage, would inherit this uncanny need to imagine one
self into and so recreate in great detail a total human situation, and
would transmit her mother's inculcated empathy into verbal descrip
tion, even as another daughter would transmit it into paint. Consider
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 11
in this light that telling image from the early memoir, &quot; Reminiscences,
of Julia Stephen &quot; standing by the open door of a railway carriage
which was taking Stella and some others to Cambridge, and striking
out in a phrase or two pictures of all the people who came past her
along the platform, and so she kept them laughing till the train went&quot;
(MB 36). This is, of course, the historic point where the attempt to
recreate for us those famous railway passengers, Mrs. Brown of &quot; Mr.
Bennett and Mrs. Brown &quot; (1924) and the unfortunate Aunt Minnie of
&quot; An Unwritten Novel &quot; (1920), begins. It suggests, rather strongly I
think, that if Leslie Stephen is the obvious source of his daugther's
critical and analytical powers, Julia Stephen is the secret source of her
creative vision. But what Virginia turned into verbal art, her mother
employed for empathetic acts of personal and social concern—a gift
which Virginia sometimes mocked but more often envied, and to which
she pays her own full empathetic tribute in her portrait of Mrs.
Ramsay.
Thus Mrs. Ramsay wants to give to her son, and to the Lighthouse
keeper and his son, and to Charles Tansley and the poor woman in
town, and to her demanding husband and frightened daughter Cam,
the reassurance they need to face life bravely; and we see in each case
how sensitively she determines and responds to that universal need.
Against her stoic solicitude, moreover, the author places Mr. Ramsay's
&quot; Damn you! &quot;—his indecent and obtuse response when she again
questions his view of tomorrow's weather:
To pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration
for other people's feelings, to rend the thin veils of civilisation
so wantonly, so brutally, was to her so horrible an outrage of
human decency that, without replying, dazed and blinded,
she bent her head as if to let the pelt of jagged hail, the drench
of dirty water, bespatter her unrebuked. There was nothing
to be said. (TTL 51)
To which silent gesture he now humbly replies that he will step over
and ask the Coastguard, if she likes, about the weather, and at once
she feels there is &quot; nobody she reverenced more &quot; and that she is &quot; not
good enough to tie his shoe strings &quot; (TTL 51). In this telling moment
Virginia Woolf presents in essence the brutality of her father's rages,
as she knew them in overwhelming fullness after his wife's death, and
the abasement of her mother's reverence for her truth-telling tyrant,
which she had witnessed in childhood. Queen and Tyrant, then, wor
12 Mark Spilka
shiping at each other's thrones in seesaw fashion; how could Virginia
Woolf accept romantic marriage after that? Yet the attempt in To the
Lighthouse is to justify, to celebrate, to commend the love between
this well-matched ill-matched pair.
Thus Lily Briscoe, in discussing Mr. Ramsay's shortcomings with her
friend William Bankes—his unselfish, generous, pure-hearted, wifeless,
childless peer and double, a great man of science and the finest man she
knows—still secretly prefers petty, selfish, vain, tyrannical, failed Mr.
Ramsay because of his &quot; fiery unworldliness,&quot; his love of dogs and
children, his homage to his wife's beauty and to the family circle over
which she presides (TTL 40-41); but above all she prefers him for the
love he shares with Mrs. Ramsay, which disarms all criticism of him
in its vital wholeness:
Directly one looked up and saw them, what she called &quot; being
in love &quot; flooded them. They became part of that unreal but
penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen
through the eyes of love. The sky stuck to them; the birds
sang through them. And, what was even more exciting, she
felt, too, as she saw Mr. Ramsay bearing down and retreating,
and Mrs. Ramsay sitting with James in the window and the
cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from being
made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by
one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up
with it and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the
beach. (TTL 72-73)
To be in love, apparently, as the Ramsays are in love, is to be
possessed by an intoxicating state which makes life whole, but which
is for some reason &quot; unreal.&quot; It is a love, moreover, peculiarly framed
by the image of &quot; Mrs. Ramsay sitting with James in the window,&quot; and
it is to this picture that Mr. Bankes responds now with a different kind
of rapture, one that disarms all criticism of Mrs. Ramsay:
For him to gaze as Lily saw him gazing at Mrs. Ramsay was a
rapture, equivalent, Lily felt, to the loves of dozens of young
men (and perhaps Mrs. Ramsay had never excited the loves of
dozens of young men). It was love, she thought, pretending
to move her canvas, distilled and filtered; love that never
attempted to clutch its object; but, like the love which math
ematicians bear their symbols, or poets their phrases, was
meant to be spread over the world and become part of the
human gain. So it was indeed. The world by all means should
On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief 13
have shared it, could Mr. Bankes have said why that woman
pleased him so; why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to
her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution
of a scientific problem, so that he rested in contemplation of
it, and felt, as he felt when he had proved something absolute
about the digestive system of plants, that barbarity was tamed,
the reign of chaos subdued. (TTL 73-74)
A love distilled and filtered, then, and so better than the clutching
loves of dozens of young men; a contemplative love, apparently, of
late-Victorian madonna and child, the absolute beauty of the maternal
bond, without which life could not begin. Such is the rapture Mrs.
Ramsay rouses in the hearts of admiring men; and in Lily's heart too,
for Mr. Bankes has just given her the aesthetic rationale for her modern
abstract painting of James and Mrs. Ramsay in the window. Fair
enough. But what are we to make of the clutching love which pre
cedes it and makes life whole? That too is a mother and child relation,
only between adults, one of whom is a fractious child soothed by mater
nal solicitude. Or is it only when Ramsay too feels this abstract rap
ture for the maternal bond, its absolute beauty, upon which he bears
down threateningly but then retreats, that life is made whole? That
seems to be the case, and Mrs. Ramsay's reciprocal reverence for his
&quot; splendid mind,&quot; his professional &quot; greatness,&quot; his worldly reputation,
seems to be its pale complement, much undercut by satiric references to
stoppage at the letter R.
Or is it quite the case? Isn't it rather an intimacy, a closeness, which
Lily Briscoe wants for herself—a living maternal bond and dependency
upon which this family circle rests, its Victorian ambience here updated
to the years before World War I? Mrs. Ramsay seems to invoke some
such closeness when she admits that marriage, which she pushes upon
all her young friends, &quot; needed—oh, all sorts of qualities ... one—she
need not name it—that was essential; the thing she had with her hus
band &quot; (TTL 93). So the abstract rapture depends upon this living
bond, this living and immediate &quot; thing,&quot; which Virginia Woolf finds
exciting and unifying, but again, as in Mrs. D allow ay, in some sense
&quot; unreal.&quot; 6
Meaning, perhaps, that there are things missing from any such bliss

ful picture which undercut its truth, or that she doesn't wholly under
stand such bliss, or can't rely on it— can't bring it off as her mother did
in different times—and therefore questions its validity. Let us assume all
three possibilities as we look at what she makes and fails to make of it.
Mrs. Ramsay herself makes the standard criticism of her queenly
role: &quot; that all this desire of hers to give, to help, was vanity . . . that
she wished so instinctively to help, to give, that people might say of
her, 'O Mrs. Ramsay! dear Mrs. Ramsay . . .' and need her and send
for her and admire her&quot; (TTL 65). She recalls, moreover, charges
made aganst her by other parents, of robbing them of their children's
affections, of &quot; Wishing to dominate, wishing to interfere &quot; and con
trol—as with her present effective attempt to bring Paul Rayley and
Minta Doyle together in a marriage which soon fares badly. And
Lily too observes the self-serving fallibility of her pity for men like
Bankes and Carmichael, who are secure in themselves and their work
and need no pity.
She is vain and manipulative, then, at her worst, in carrying out her
queenly role. Her jealousy of Minta once the engagement she has
maneuvered has taken place and her husband has responded gallantly
to the young girl's &quot; golden haze,&quot; her awareness of his preference for
&quot; these golden-reddish girls, with something ... a little wild and
harum-scarum about them . . . some quality which she herself had
not&quot; (TTL 148-149), suggests further a vicarious involvement in the
marriages she urges, as if she sought thereby some missing component
in her own marriage to the otherwise dried-up Ramsay. Does she then
dominate and manipulate him so he will need and admire her, and per
haps also withhold something from him in revenge for his own with
holdings?
There is much evidence in the text, and in the lives behind the text,
which supports these points. Consider first the traces of Julia Stephen's
first marriage to Herbert Duckworth. Early in the novel, when Mrs.
Ramsay hears that the Swiss maid's father is dying of cancer (as would
Leslie Stephen at 72) and responds with that characteristic sadness that
so enhances her beauty, there is a speculative passage following the
repeated refrain, &quot; Never did anybody look so sad
But was it nothing but looks, people said? What was there
behind it—her beauty and splendour? Had he blown his brains
out, they asked, had he died the week before they were [to
be] married—some other, earlier lover, of whom rumours

The last thought probably refers to her ability to hit
assuasions of terror or despair, by which a boar's

also draws away, oddly, from her problematic sadn
porizing &quot; falsely perhaps &quot; obscures the fact that an at

Is Mrs. Ramsay's borrowed silence a coverup for miss

has nothing to tell. Yet she is also silent or evasive wh

Well, yes, of course she loves him, but triumphing over him is also
necessary to her love; and though it is supposed to imply the triumph
of unspoken communication, of selfless inner being, over the inade
quacies of words and the vanities of mere personalities, it may mean
something else as well: namely, that she doesn't love him passionately,
as Julia Duckworth loved Herbert, and so can't tell him she loves him
in so many words. Suppose we posit here that her spoken vows belong
to another man, a ghostly thief of love who exists, or once existed,
outside the text, but whom Virginia Woolf is now trying (not always
successfully) to suppress? 7 This would explain Mrs. Ramsay's curious
silences, and it would also explain why she is so remote from Ramsay,
in her melancholia, that he cannot &quot; protect her.&quot; After all, what
intuitive &quot; simplicity &quot; makes her behave in these remote and silent
ways—she who has so many reassuring words for other sufferers and,
indeed, for all his other sufferings? Is it really because &quot;He could say
things&quot; whereas &quot; she never could say what she felt,&quot; as Virginia
Woolf asserts (TTL 185)?
In a recent review of Leslie Stephen's Mausoleum Book Francis
Wyndham makes the nice point that Julia Stephen remained &quot; a kind of
widow &quot; even through her second marriage, &quot; serenely moving in a
higher sphere where the consciousness of tragedy was never far from
the surface.&quot; 8 It was a sphere so high, apparently, that Leslie Stephen,
like Mr. Ramsay, could never reach her. He too wanted to break into
her sorrow—wanted her to say in so many words, &quot; I love you —and
had to settle for loving her reticence when she did not. No wonder
that Virginia Stephen fantasied for her reticent mother a dead clergy
man husband whom she longed for (MB 82), and hallucinated a deathly
reunion for her, a mysterious man sitting on the edge of her bed when
she died, as if filling out the family script! (MB 92). But for Mrs.
Ramsay she could not bring herself to imagine, much less hallucinate,
that missing widowhood which explains her silent, remote, and melan
choly ways, nor that romantic first marriage which explains her with
holdings and her apparent need to keep Ramsay hanging and unsatis
fied, as he obviously kept her long unsatisfied, whatever their domestic
bliss. A de facto widow, she has settled for maternal control over her
dependent childlike husband, and has encouraged his dependency, in

On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief 17
the absence of, among other things, that &quot; great passion,&quot; sexual as well
as affectionate, which she might have enjoyed with a different husband.
In the text itself the absence of such passion between the Ramsays
is hinted at in several ways. The most obvious confirmation comes
when Ramsay retires to his study after dinner, still smarting from a
rebuff to Scott's fiction which implies that his own work might not last,
and finds in Scott's handling of &quot; poor Steenie's drowning and Muckle
backit's sorrow &quot; in The Antiquary evidence not only of his lasting
value but of his superiority as well to French novelists in their concern
with sexual love (TTL 180). Invigorated and moved to tears by Scott's
example, Ramsay uses the word &quot; fiddlesticks &quot; to define the French
concern; and watching his wife reading Shakespeare's sonnets beside
him, he further concludes that &quot; the whole of life did not consist in
going to bed with a woman &quot; (TTL 181). In weeping over death and
dismissing sex he is, of course, very much like his Clapham forbears,
as A. O. J. Cockshut argues,9 but the comfort he takes here for his own
professional failure may also reflect another kind of failure. Mrs. Ram
say intimates as much while dressing for dinner and seeing outside the
window a sight which always amuses her, &quot; the rooks trying to decide
which tree to settle on,&quot; and the old father rook with half his wing
feathers missing, &quot; a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition &quot;
whom she calls &quot; old Joseph,&quot; fighting with another rook:
&quot; Look! &quot; she said, laughing. They were actually fighting.
Joseph and Mary were fighting. Anyhow they all went up
again, and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and
cut into exquisite scimitar shapes. (TTL 121-122)
If this parable on her own marriage makes her laugh, and its outcome
seems to her lovely, and if she tries now to keep her son Jasper from
shooting at such pathetic personified birds, those &quot; scimitar shapes&quot;
remind us all the same of that sterile beak of brass, &quot; the arid scimitar
of the male,&quot; which plunges into her &quot; fountain and spray of life &quot; in
earlier pages, demanding sympathy. Of course, all males seem sterile
to Mrs. Ramsay, and in need of her protection; but the Joseph and
Mary story goes beyond sterility to suggest displacement by some
more potent spirit—such as Herbert Duckworth.

18 Mark Spilka
Mrs. Ramsay's recollections of Carrie and Herbert Manning in her
dinner conversation with William Bankes, who has received a letter
from Carrie, may yield still another trace of that more potent spirit:
for the Mannings were a couple she had known briefly twenty years
back (the time, relatively, of Julia Stephen's first marriage) who did
things decisively, stuck to plans when they made them, slayed pesky
dragons (&quot; Never should she forget Herbert killing a wasp with a tea
spoon on the bank&quot;), and lived in a &quot;dream land&quot; of the past, in
their house on the Thames, where life lay &quot; like a lake, placidly be
tween its banks,&quot; and where she moved &quot; without haste or anxiety;
for there was no future to worry about.&quot; Now, as she converses about
them with Bankes, she moves about &quot; like a ghost &quot; on that day &quot; very
still and beautiful&quot; when she first visited them (TTL 132, 140). But
she hasn't thought about them for years, and it is probably too much
to find in this preserved idyll more than a few traces—a suggestively
virile name and manner, a protected carefree life—of that missing first
marriage. We may want to place more emphasis instead on the tale of
the fisherman and his wife Mrs. Ramsay reads that day to her son
James, the fairy tale which figures so importantly in everybody's
vision of the Ramsay's love:
She read on: &quot; Ah wife,&quot; said the man, &quot; why should we be
King? I do not want to be King.&quot; &quot; Well,&quot; said the wife, &quot; if
you won't be King, I will; go to the Flounder, for I will be
King.&quot; (TTL 86)
Somewhere between the first and third sections of the novel Mr.
Ramsay, a decided flounderer in kingly matters himself, seems to have
gone to the Flounder for advice about his wife's request; for in taking
the children to the Lighthouse he belatedly acknowledges her King
ship, involving not merely her supremacy in love but also her tight
ness about the primacy of kindness over truth. It is his kind of mis
sion, moreover, an heroic expedition, most of which he spends with his
head buried in a book, to deliver the brown parcels she had planned
to send to the keeper and his son ten years before. On the journey
Ramsay is said to &quot; escape &quot; into his book, which becomes an expedi
tion in thought, a scramble up mental mountains. But books and
poems have other functions for him, and the question of what he is
doing inside them is crucial to his character.
&quot; Someone had blundered &quot; is the refrain he repeats aloud through
the first section of the novel, embarrassing his wife and his guests by
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 19
the intensity of his involvement with the poem's futile heroics. In
Tennyson's &quot; Charge of the Light Brigade,&quot; itself a prime example of
the pointless heroic posturing of an age unsure of its values, Mr. Ram
say finds a moving instance of his own self-dramatizing pity, his
own pointlessly heroic blunders as a failed philosopher. And he is
ridiculously lovable, if embarrassing, in being forced to seek emotional
comfort in this manner. His Victorian posturing takes a more mellow
form as both he and Augustus Carmichael recite Charles Elton's
&quot;Luriana, Lurilee&quot; at the end of dinner (TTL 166-167), and so
acknowledge his wife's unifying social powers, her dinner-table artis
try, which in its creation of a human stay against chaotic night par
takes (we are told) &quot;of eternity&quot; (TTL 158).
On the voyage to the Lighthouse the refrain which possesses him,
and which his children echo as they come to side with him, is &quot; we
perished, each alone,&quot; from Cowper's &quot; The Castaway.&quot; He has been
living inside this poem, apparently, since his wife's death, and—if at
71 he has, like Leslie Stephen, only a year more to live— in anticipation
of his own. In his excitement he repeats the lines aloud, to his child
ren's outrage, and then murmurs gently the self-pitying lines: &quot; But I
beneath a rougher sea/Was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he.&quot; Tak
ing &quot; he &quot; as his wife we may indeed ponder his continuing vanity;
but if the &quot; he &quot; is also Herbert Duckworth, in its biographical ambigu
ities, he has his point. He has lived longer and more dependently with
the same woman, has now outlived her rather than died before her, and
is more lost without her than she would be without him—or than her
prototype was without Herbert Duckworth. But if his extremes of
grief and vanity reflect his continuing dependency, he has nonetheless
converted, in his remoteness, his gloom, his dignity, and now in his
symbolic act of compassion, to her side. We learn of his tyranny in
his widower years from his children, but all we see of it is their
forced obedience now in joining his Lighthouse mission. We learn of
his insatiable demands for sympathy in his grief from women, and of
his delight in receiving it: but when, with histrionic groans and sighs, he
demands such sympathy now from Lily Briscoe, and she finally manages
to compliment his boots, he is released by her comic tribute to male
vanity to a new and final phase &quot; when it seemed as if he had shed
worries and ambitions, and the hope of sympathy and the desire for
praise, had entered some other region, was drawn on, as if by curiosity,
in dumb colloquy, whether with himself or another, at the head of that
little procession out of one's range &quot; (TTL 233). So Lily last sees him,
20 Mark Spilka
this man who in her previous angry judgment &quot; never gave,&quot; always
&quot; took &quot; (TTL 223). But he has just given her a lesson in tying knots,
in return for her compliment, and has moved her thereby to tears of
sympathy which will help her to untie the mental knot that binds her
painter's mind. And on the voyage to the Lighthouse he gives to his
daughter Cam sufficient sympathy to remind her of those library
moments &quot; when he was not vain, nor a tyrant, and did not wish you
to pity him,&quot; and was likely to ask &quot; as gently as any one could, Was
there nothing he could give her? &quot; (TTL 282). And to his son James,
who still wants to kill him for childhood tyrannies, for brutal sar
casms and intolerable vanities now recalled, he gives the expeditionary
kudo, &quot; Well done! &quot; and so includes him in his own stern vision of
stoic manhood (TTL 306). And to them he seems himself a &quot;young
man &quot; again, brave and upright in a godless world—a young man for
whom they will &quot; do anything,&quot; as he springs from the boat to the
Lighthouse rock (TTL 308).
This was how Virginia Woolf saw her father in his final days, when
it seemed to her a new and better phase of his life was just beginning.
Cam and James at 17 and 16, like Virginia and Adrian at 22 and 21,
are old enough to begin to be possible companions to their father; so
there is fit lightheartedness to this final tribute to his better fictive self.
But the spirit which moves him, and which makes him accessible to
his children, is that of his wife, whose belief in the need for reassurance
in a godless world he now quixotically expedites and (all too faintly)
mimes, and so reunites the family he has ravaged, more savagely in
life than in this fiction, and for them at least unites her wisdom with
his own ability to reach the letter R.
This was as close as Virginia Woolf would come to imagining a man
strong enough to match her mother's emotionally creative powers and
to restore her own shaky belief in romantic marriage. She knew, from
the intense mothering she received from Leonard Woolf, particularly
in the early years of their marriage, that men are not by definition
emotionally sterile, that they too may provide nurturing love; but she
never acknowledged this in her fiction—never showed a woman de
pending as heavily as she did upon Leonard for the strength and reas
surance to go on being creative, being herself. The demands she made
upon his sympathies were more terrible, if more real, than those her
father made upon his wife and daughters. Ller fear of failure in her
writings, her preoccupation with literary fame, was more devastating
in its consequences for Leonard and herself, in terms of actual illness,
On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief 21
than her father's all-too-exemplary fears in their immediate conse
quences for his wife and family; but of course it is his egotism she
repeats and dislikes in herself—and castigates in him. Her &quot; madness &quot;
was her excuse for faults very like his own, to which she never really
admitted, perhaps because of her concern with &quot; greatness,&quot; in which
—to be sure—her husband shared.
She was right, however, to look to her mother's life for some in
sight into her own creative powers and possibilities, for she owed most
of her creative strengths—her intuitive, empathetic, and poetic powers,
her impressive private reaches, her easy sociabilities—to this remarkable
woman. But she could not look to her mother's death in this novel,
nor even in The Years, without being overwhelmed in that deeper gulf
of self-dramatizing pity her father so foolishly claimed for himself,
hence she wisely avoided it. This meant, however, that she had to bor
row Lily Briscoe's grief from her own buried fund of confused child
hood feelings, minus her own psychic history, even as she had bor
rowed Mrs. Ramsay's silences from Julia Stephen's absent widowhood.
The &quot; Time Passes &quot; section of the novel is itself the prime reflection
in Virginia Woolf's fiction of her initial inability to grieve her mother's
death, and of the long delay in releasing her unspent emotions.10 Instead
of facing up in this section to the impact of Mrs. Ramsay's death
upon her husband and children, she devotes it to the question of her
continuing spiritual presence and leaves her death for the family
friend, Lily Briscoe, to cope with ten years later. Lily's position in
this regard is very much like her own in writing the novel; but then
the evasiveness of the &quot; Time Passes &quot; section is very much her own
evasiveness in breaking &quot; the unity of [her] design.&quot; Her nominal
intention is to show, through the passage of time, the randomness of
senseless death and the persistence beyond it of certain imperishable
human qualities. Her choice of the summer home at Skye is in this
regard like her choice of Jacob's room, in the novel of that title, as a
register of human presence. As such it runs counter to her objections
to Arnold Bennett's fiction in &quot; Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown,&quot; where

environmental detail was supposedly inadequate as an index to human
character; but she works the environment for unusual spiritual evi
dence, almost for mystic meaning.
Narrating the section through the common selfless voice she had
developed in Mrs. Dalloway, she personifies the forces of change and
disintegration as &quot;the little airs,&quot; detached from the rougher wind out
side, which press through the deserted house asking assorted domestic
objects how long they will endure. The allegorical device is, to say
the least, precious and pretentious, not because &quot;airs&quot; are unsuitable to a
decaying summer house as agents of disintegrative inquiry, but because
the level of inquiry is too safely abstruse to yield much heartfelt mean
ing. Walt Disney's animated cartoons often do as well or better with
such devices, though for less serious ends. We learn nonetheless that
the bedrooms of the house stand fast against the first inroads of decay,
if only because there are still living sleepers inside them. It is the last
night of summer occupancy, after which the &quot; stray airs, advance
guards of great armies,&quot; may come in and do their work without
human resistance. But even then the loveliness and stillness observed by
common selfless consciousness remain steadfast in the bedroom, clasping
ethereal hands, as evidence that the spirit of Mrs. Ramsay still persists.
Meanwhile &quot;divine goodness,&quot; also personified, is foiled by the forces
of destruction; anonymous sleepless beach-walkers are unable to get
answers from the sea and the night as to the whys and wherefores of
existence; and the death of Mrs. Ramsay is recorded in a brief paren
thesis:
[Mr. Ramsey, stumbling along a passage one dark morning,
stretched his arms out, but Mrs. Ramsay having died rather
suddenly the night before, his arms, though stretched out,
remained empty.] (TTL 194)
We know that Virginia Stephen offered to fill such arms on the actual
occasion of her mother's death, when her father charged past her
without noticing her need to share their common grief (MB 91). She
may well be avenging herself here, but death's ironic triumph is all we
witness.
Shortly after this the 70-year-old cleaning woman, Mrs. NcNab,
arrives to sing her witless caretaking song of human persistency, and
we get one of those painfully inauthentic attempts, like that of the beg
garwoman in the park in Mrs. Dalloivay, to show the historic sweep
of human suffering through the sensibility of a proletarian woman.
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 23
Then the deaths of Prue and Andrew Ramsay are parenthetically
recorded—hers (like Stella Duckworth's) from &quot; some illness con
nected with childbirth&quot; (TTL 199); his (like Jacob Flanders') by
an exploding shell in France in World War I (TTL 201); and the nar
rative view expands to include &quot; gigantic chaos &quot; outside the house and
&quot; idiotic games &quot; (recalling the author's fear of the &quot; idiot boy&quot; in
childhood, MB 78) in a universe &quot;battling and tumbling, in brute
confusion and wanton lust aimlessly by itself &quot; (TTL 202-203). Against
these odds the heroic Mrs. McNab invokes now her sisterly memory
of Mrs. Ramsay coming up the drive with the washing, calling out to
the servants, stooping over her flowers, then dissolving into a yellow
beamed lady in a grey cloak (recalling that womblike &quot; film of semi
transparent yellow &quot; through which the author peered in childhood,
MB 65) wandering over the walls and furniture with her as she works.
The Lighthouse beam, with which Airs. Ramsay had identified in one
of her selfless and eternal moments of private wedge-shaped being
while she lived, underscores her persisting presence; and so inspirited,
the forces of human persistency prevail as Mrs. McNab, joined by Mrs.
Bast and her son George, begin to restore the house to its former habit
ableness, in preparation for the approaching expeditionary hero, Mr.
Ramsay, four of his six remaining children, the belated mourner Lily
Briscoe, and other friends. By these worked-up allegorical devices,
then, the impersonal narrator sweeps over the actual impact of Julia
Stephen's death, the funereal gloom, tyranny, and outrage which en
veloped her survivors, and the severities of unworked grief and mental
breakdown from which, we know, the need to write this novel arose.
If sentimentality is, as I. A. Richards holds, a form of inhibition, the
middle section is decidedly sentimental.
The question of unworked grief is left, of course, for Lily Briscoe
to solve in the final section. But why she should grieve Mrs. Ramsay at
all, or be so involved with her in life as to feel such want, pain, and anger
at her death, we do not know. Nor does the concluding section ever
explain it. Still, in memorable and moving fashion, it records the
emotions and confusions which Virginia Woolf herself must have
undergone at the time of her mother's death, and the process of thera
peutic release she underwent, along with Lily, in creating this objective
correlative for grieving. Thus Lily, like Virginia at her mother's death
bed and for thirty years thereafter, feels &quot; Nothing, nothing—nothing
that she could express at all &quot; on coming back &quot;after all these years and
24 Mark Spilka
Mrs. Ramsay dead &quot; (TTL 217). Alone at the breakfast table, she again
wonders why she has come, for the thought of &quot;Mrs. Ramsay dead;
Andrew killed; Prue dead too—repeat it as she might,—roused no feel
ing in her&quot; (TTL 219). She is also angry with Mrs. Ramsay for
dying and leaving her to cope with Mr. Ramsay's oppressive demands
for sympathy, which prevent her from redoing her unfinished painting
of ten years past. The incommensurate nature of her anger is instruc
tive; her reaction to Mr. Ramsay in the crucial passage below, and to
Mrs. Ramsay as its departed secret cause, is that of a child raised by
colossal parents rather than a friend on a weekend stay at a summer
house. As such it is plainly borrowed from the author's life and smug
gled into this 44-year-old spinster's midlife crisis, her wasting time and
talent, which for no evident reason she also blames on Mrs. Ramsay:
That man, she thought, her anger rising in her, never gave;
that man took. She, on the other hand, would be forced to
give. Mrs. Ramsay had given. Giving, giving, giving she had
died—and had left all this. Really, she was very angry with
Mrs. Ramsay. With the brush slightly trembling in her fingers
she looked at the hedge, the step, the wall. Here was Lily, at
forty-four, wasting her time, unable to do a thing, standing
there, playing at painting, playing at the one thing one did
not play at, and it was all Mrs. Ramsay's fault. She was dead.
The step where she used to sit was empty. She was dead.
But why repeat this over and over again? Why be always
trying to bring up some feeling she had not got? There was a
kind of blasphemy in it. It was all dry; all withered; all
spent. (TTL 223-224)
Why indeed does Lily feel this terrible repeated need to bring up
some long-blocked feeling about Mrs. Ramsay's death? The text never
tells us; the life-sources of her unworked grief are all we have to go
by—the image from the late memoir, for instance, of Virginia Stephen,
aged 13, stretching out her arms to a father who never gave, on that
early morning when a mother who gave too much had stopped giving
altogether and had left her to cope with life's confusions. Her anger
with her mother for leaving her, implicit then in her inability to grieve,
is filtered now through this spinster surrogate whose childlike attach
ment to the Ramsays is so oddly and inexplicably a textual given. One
brief notation, that she is a spinster who keeps house for her father off
the Brompton Road (TTL 32), allows us to deduce the rationale for
her attachment: for she has obviously lost her mother at some unspeci

to convert her ungrieved grief into a lasting por
beloved:
L'or how could one express in words these emotions of the
body? express that emptiness there? (She was looking at the
drawing-room steps; they looked extraordinarily empty.) It
was one's body feeling, not one's mind. The physical sensa
tions that went with that bare look of the steps had become
suddenly extremely unpleasant. To want and not to have,
sent all up her a hardness, a hollowness, a strain. And then to
want and not to have—to want and want—how that wrung
the heart, and wrung it again and again! Oh, Mrs. Ramsay!
she called out silently, to that essence which sat by the boat,
26 Mark Spilka
that abstract one made of her, that woman in grey, as if to
abuse her for having gone, and then having gone, come back
again. It had seemed so safe, thinking of her. Ghost, air,
nothingness, a thing you could play with easily and safely at
any time of the day or night, she had been that, and then sud
denly she put her hand out and wrung the heart thus. (TTL
266)
Lily's heart is wrung, apparently, by the grief which Virginia
Stephen had failed to release when her mother died, by her anger at
being deserted by the woman whose love she wanted so much,11 and
by the return of that repressed anger and its beloved ghostly object.
Thus Lily's eyes now fill with tears, as she tries to look at her painting,
and she cries for Mrs. Ramsay &quot; without being aware of any unhappi
ness &quot; (TTL 268). Then, calling in imagination to old Mr. Carmichael
on the lawn beside her, she begins asking questions about such un
expected and miraculous events, and she feels &quot; that if they both got
up, here, now on the lawn, and demanded an explanation &quot; of life as
to its shortness and inexplicability,
then beauty would roll itself up; the space would fill; those
empty flourishes would form into shapes; if they shouted loud
enough Mrs. Ramsay would return. &quot; Mrs. Ramsay! &quot; she
said aloud, &quot; Mrs. Ramsay! &quot; The tears ran down her face.
CTTL 268)
When Mrs. Ramsay fails to come Lily is ashamed of her ignomin
ious cry of pain and want and &quot; bitter anger but gradually the pain
subsides and, with &quot; a relief that was balm in itself,&quot; she senses Mrs.
Ramsay's presence by her side, then sees her moving off in all her
beauty, &quot; raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which

Lily squeezed her tubes again. She attacked that problem of
the hedge. It was strange how clearly she saw her, stepping
with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds,
purplish and soft, among whose flowers, hyacinth or lilies,

On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 27
she vanished. It was some trick of the painter's eye. For days
after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus, putting
her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with
her companion, a shade across the fields. The sight, the
phrase, had its power to console. Wherever she happened to
be, painting, here, in the country or in London the vision
would come to her, and her eyes, half closing, sought some
thing to base her vision on. She looked down the railway
carriage, the omnibus; took a line from shoulder or creek;
looked at the windows opposite, at Piccadilly, lamp-strung
in the evening. All had been part of the fields of death. (TTL
269-270, italics mine)
Virginia Woolf's first memories were of riding with her mother
on train and bus going to Cornwall (MB 64); and on her mother's
death she had even hallucinated that man sitting on the edge of her
mother's bed (MB 92) whom I am going to propose now as the other
wise unidentified companion with whom Mrs. Ramsay goes so un
questioningly, &quot; a shade across the fields.&quot; We may want to call the
companion Death rather than Herbert Duckworth; but I think the
edge lies rather with some waiting former mortal, as it did when her
mother died, and that the consolation lies in Stella Duckworth's pre
scient response to that hallucination: &quot; It's nice that she shouldn't be
alone&quot; (MB 92). Certainly the two companions Lily later imagines
with Mrs. Ramsay, when she groups her death with those of Prue and
Andrew, are former mortals; but even here, as the three shades move
together across the fields, Mrs. Ramsay walks &quot; rather fast in front, as
if she expected to meet some one round the corner&quot; (TTL 299)—
no doubt her previous companion of the fields, our fictive prototype
for the ghost of Herbert Duckworth, that first and most beloved hus
band of Julia Stephen.12
It is at this point, when Lily has grouped her dead, that someone
sits in the drawing-room chair where Mrs. Ramsay had first posed for
121 identify Mrs. Ramsay's two companions on p. 299 as Prue and Andrew
because Prue has just joined her in death and Andrew's death has been previously
on Lily's mind (p. 289) as she ponders old Carmichael's strong reaction to it.
But actually Andrew died after Prue died, not before, so the grouping on p. 299
might be that of Prue, Mrs. Ramsay, and our unidentified friend noted on p. 270.
In which case Mrs. Ramsay may walk on ahead to meet Andrew when he dies.
That she walked so in life, as Woolf notes on pp. 19-20, suggests that she has
always been on the lookout for such deathly companions, or for her impending
deathly reunion with at least one who had gone before hex.

her painting, and settles &quot; by some stroke of luck so as to throw an
odd-shaped triangular shadow over the step.&quot; With this symbol of
private wedge-shaped selfless being reestablished, Mrs. Ramsay again
comes back to her. At first the old horror—&quot; to want and want and
not to have &quot;—comes back too; but when Mrs. Ramsay seems to re
frain from inflicting it, it becomes &quot; part of ordinary experience,&quot;
and Lily moves to the edge of the lawn to share her vision of Mrs.
Ramsay in her &quot; perfect goodness,&quot; knitting the reddish-brown stock
ing for the Lighthouse keeper's boy, with Mr. Ramsay, whom she
now &quot; wants &quot; for the first time. And in this state of resolved emotion
she is able to finish her painting.
What does it mean when Lily says of Mr. Ramsay now, &quot; She
wanted him&quot; (TTL 300)? Will the 44-year-old spinster marry the
71-year-old widower? That seems unlikely, though Mrs. Ramsay had
once intended her for Ramsay's contemporary, William Bankes. The
more probable meaning is that she is now sufficiently one with Mrs.
Ramsay to be able to give him freely the womanly sympathy he needs;
and in fact, as she surmises that he has reached the Lighthouse, she feels
that &quot; Whatever she had wanted to give him, when he left her that
morning, she had given him at last &quot; (TTL 308-309). It is an odd con
clusion, since he is not there to benefit from her changed condition, her
newfound &quot; wanting &quot; for him; but perhaps she has beamed it over to
him, mystically, or perhaps, in becoming capable of supportive sym
pathy, she has become the kind of woman Ramsay would approve, and
in that sense has conceded to him what she could never before con
cede. In either case she has become the Ramsay's common heir, a
surrogate daughter capable of grieving her mother and comforting
her father, and of loving them both selflessly, without clutching
demands.
A lovely heritage, then, however long-delayed. Not many of us
are able to come to such gratifying terms with our departed or depart
ing parents. But, as Lily's borrowings from the author's life attest,
there is something missing in her artistic vision of parental love and
daughterly devotion. Ideally she would be released now from spinster
hood, or at least from her skeptical view of the Ramsays' marriage. And
she does arrive at a vision of their engagement which seems to be
her touchstone for romantic love. Thus, late in the novel, remember
ing how Ramsay would stop dead in front of his wife and &quot; some
curious shock&quot; would pass through her (TTL 294), she converts the
scene into an instance of romantic vowing:
On Lily Briscoe's Borrowed Grief 29
He stretched out his hand and raised her from the chair. It
seemed somehow as if he had once bent in the same way and
raised her from a boat which, lying a few inches off some
island, had required that the ladies should thus be helped on
shore by the gentlemen. An old-fashioned scene that was,
which required, very nearly, crinolines and peg-top trousers.
Letting herself be helped by him, Mrs. Ramsay had thought
(Lily supposed) the time has come now. Yes, she would say
it now. Yes, she would marry him. And she stepped slowly,
quietly on shore. Probably she said one word only, letting
her hand rest still on his; but no more. Time after time the
same thrill had passed between them—obviously it had, Lily
thought. . . . She was not inventing; she was only trying to
smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up;
something she had seen. (TTL 295)
If Lily is not inventing, Virginia is. As she knew from her father's
Mausoleum Book, her mother had agreed to marry him while seated in
an armchair by her own fireplace one January evening in 1878; she had
done so in seventeen words, not one, and only after lengthy verbal
vacillations recorded in a year's exchange of letters. The crinolines and
peg-top trousers came, moreover, from those summers at Little Hol
land House in her youth—the &quot;summer afternoon world&quot; of eminent
men and ladies over which Virginia rhapsodizes in her memoirs {MB
86-87)—when her mother had not yet met Stephen (who had found the
place too &quot; alarming &quot; for his taste when he glimpsed her there in
1866!); and the boating metaphor no doubt derived from the tour of
Venice and/or Lake Lucerne that summer where Julia met (and
shortly after married) Herbert Duckworth.13 In other words, Virginia
Woolf has transposed the charged romantic ambience of her mother's
first engagement to her second, as if finally restoring stolen love! She
has restored the missing depth of passion, as signalled by electric vow
ing, but whether she has done so by sure creative instinct, or by
sleight of hand, seems so uncertain that she questions it herself.
Thus Lily moves immediately from this &quot; folded &quot; and decidedly sus
13 See Leslie Stephen's The Mausoleum Book (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
1977), 57, for the actual acceptance scene, and 47-57 for the epistolary vacilla
tions leading up to it. See 30-31 for his 1866 visit to Little Holland House.
Stephen places the Venice visit (when Julia first met Duckworth) in 1862, when
she was 16, and leaves the Lake Lucerne meeting indefinite (34, 36). In her own
memoirs Virginia Woolf collates the Venice visit with her mother's first mar
riage when she was 21 (MB 89).

pect memory to the Ramsays' quarrels—the bedroom door slamming,
Mr. Ramsay whizzing a plate through the window—tempests which,
though soon resolved in garden colloquies, had taken their emotional
toll on Mrs. Ramsay. A bit earlier, moreover, she types such occasions
as instances of Mrs. Ramsay's weakness with her husband, for &quot; She let
him make those scenes &quot; (TTL 291). The problem relates to her own
reluctance to sympathize with this man who never gave, only took.
Still, as his token giving on the Lighthouse journey attests, he seems to
have learned something about reciprocity since his wife's death, and to
that extent the novel defines the possibility, at least, of mutually sup
portive, if not electric love. This much, we may hazard, Virginia
Woolf herself was able to achieve in her companionate marriage with
Leonard Woolf as part of her own parental heritage. But the problem
also relates back to Lily's antipathy toward the sexual aspects of mar
riage as signalled by those electric thrills. In the opening section of the
novel she had been possessed by &quot; the vibration of love &quot; between Paul
Rayley and Minta Doyle, so much so that when Paul announced his
intention to get up early in the morning to search the beach for Minta's
missing brooch, Lily wanted to join him:
Lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire
to help him, envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she
would be the one to pounce on the brooch half-hidden by
some stone, and thus herself be included among the sailors
and adventurers. But what did he reply to her offer? She
actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear, &quot; Let
me come with you,&quot; and he laughed. He meant yes or no—
either perhaps. But it was not his meaning—it was the odd
chuckle he gave, as if he had said, Throw yourself over the
cliff if you like, I don't care. He turned on her cheek the
heat of love, its horror, its cruelty, its unscrupulosity. It
scorched her, and Lily, looking at Minta, being charming to
Mr. Ramsay at the other end of the table, flinched for her
exposed to those fangs, and was thankful. For at any rate, she
said to herself, catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern,
she need not marry, thank Heaven; she need not undergo that
degradation. She was saved from that dilution. She would
move the tree rather more to the middle. (TTL 153-154)
Taking this with the undiluted grain of salt provided above, as the
traditional sour-grapes response of a spinster who finds compensation
in her painting, the difficulty it raises for romantic marriage is none
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Grief 31
theless considerable. For, as Lily now concludes, the &quot; love between
Paul and Minta—so beautiful and exciting &quot; that she trembles &quot; on the
verge of it&quot; and offers to look for the missing brooch—is also &quot; the
stupidest, the most barbaric of human passions, and turns a nice young
man with a profile like a gem's (Paul's was exquisite) into a bully with a
crowbar (he was swaggering, he was insolent) in the Mile End Road &quot;
(TTL 154). And she further finds it &quot; tedious, puerile, and inhumane,&quot;
though also &quot;beautiful and necessary&quot; (TTL 155). Having arrived at
this internal impasse, she is willing to wait for any further &quot; light upon
the question of love &quot; that conversation or time may bring; but ten
years later, when she thinks again of the Rayleys, it is only to take
satisfaction in their marital disharmonies, in her own spinsterhood, and
in Mrs. Ramsay's obvious wrongness about them all. Yet at this very
moment of her triumph over Mrs. Ramsay, she is again seized by love's
barbaric power:
Suddenly, as suddenly as a star slides in the sky, a reddish
light seemed to burn in her mind, covering Paul Rayley, issu
ing from him. It rose like a fire sent up in token of some
celebration by savages on a distant beach. She heard the roar
and the crackle. The whole sea for miles around ran red and
gold. Some winey smell mixed with it and intoxicated her,
for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw herself off
the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a
beach. And the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear
and disgust, as if while she saw its splendour and power she
saw too how it fed on the treasure of the house, greedily,
disgustingly, and she loathed it. But for a sight, for a glory
it surpassed everything in her experience, and burnt year after
year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge of the sea,
and one had only to say &quot; in love &quot; and instantly, as happened
now, up rose Paul's fire again. And it sank and she said to her
self, laughing, &quot;The Rayleys &quot;. . . . (TTL 261-262)
As the passage makes abundantly clear, Lily has been sexually attract
ed to Paul Rayley all these years. But by defining &quot; in love &quot; by his
sexual powers, she has moved away from her original definition of
what &quot; being in love &quot; meant for the Ramsays. Their crinolines and
peg-top trousers seem quite civilized by contrast with Paul's bar
baric fires, and we are forced to conclude that their romantic marriage
is in some sense asexual, for all the thrills and shocks which occur when
their eyes and hands meet: or perhaps more fairly, that their sexuality
32 Mark Spilka
has been channeled into borrowed gallantries and real quarrels, that
compassion is their ruling mode, and that there are no depths of pas
sion between them.
Are we supposed to choose then between marriages of passion and
compassion? Not, surely, if they produce bullies of sexuality like
Paul Rayley, on the one hand, and bullies of sympathy like Mr. Ram
say on the other. Is Mr. Ramsay's belated reciprocity the corrective
answer? It makes him strong again, but we know already how much
he minimizes sexual love. It seems to me, rather, that Lily is confused,
that she can deal with sexual attraction between the Rayleys, but not
between the Ramsays, because she shares in the author's inability to
confront this aspect of her parents' marriage. We have already seen
how Virginia Woolf suppresses Mrs. Ramsay's rumored first love,
gives to Minta that &quot; harum-scarum&quot; wildness Mrs. Ramsay sup
posedly lacks, and denies Mrs. Ramsay the clutching admiration of
dozens of young men—-though in fact Julia Stephen was much sought
after in her youth (QB, I, 17) and seems to have had a passionate first
marriage. (MB 89-90). In Lily's repulsion from that fire which feeds
&quot; on the treasure of the house,&quot; then, we see the author's repulsion
from the grievous effects of sexuality on her treasured mother, who
left her, as it were, to rejoin her sexually attractive first husband in
the fields of death. But this means that the boating metaphor for the
Ramsays' romantic union is suspect, that the vital wholeness between
them, the unifying wave of life which joins them, is indeed imperfectly
understood, and that there is after all something sentimental and &quot; un
real &quot; about their depiction, something confused, at least, in the author's
understanding of what makes for romantic marriage—indeed, some
thing transposed from the Duckworth marriage to the Stephen mar
riage which doesn't really belong there! But at least she could move
into her mother's mind and heart in the compelling first section, and
could break through, in the final section, to that moving expression of
anger, grief, and love which releases her surrogate to selfless sympathy
for parental figures and creative independence for herself. This freed
her for a time from her parental ghosts, and released her—not to more
deeply romantic marriage with Leonard Woolf—but to the andro
gynous vision of Orlando and to what seems to have been a lesbian
affair with Vita Sackville-West (QB, II, 116-120, 183). For it was that
stronger woman, that true King Mrs. Ramsay, after all, and not that
&quot;king in exile&quot; (TTL 222), Mr. Ramsay, whom she wanted bodily
On Lily Briscoe s Borrowed Griff 33
for herself. That, finally, was what was behind her dread of the novel s
sentimental theme. She had become a married spinster, as her mother
before her had become a married widow, and like Clarissa Dalloway,
could join passion with affection only with another woman, and then
only fleetingly, clutchingly, as an exultant adolescent crush, and there
fore—as private liberations go—without much &quot; human gain.&quot; 14
11 For a much more positive view of the benefits of the Sackville-West affair,
see Phyllis Rose, Woman of Letters: A Life of Virginia Woolf (New York:
Oxford University Press, 1978), pp. 175-193. Rose connects the affair with the
period of rebellion and independent growth in which Woolf produced her most
important feminist writings. My own skepticism here is confined to the quality
of the affair, which does not seem to me to have been between equals. I take
it that writing To the Lighthouse allowed Virginia to express finally her genuine
love for her mother, and so separate it from those confused adolescent yearn
ings for hex which had acquired an erotic dimension since her death—which she
was now free to bestow on another maternal (if masculine) woman. Given
the adolescent nature of her involvement, it does not seem to me surprising that
the affair soon fizzled out. This does not detract from her public heroism and
her newfound political maturity at this time; but it does suggest that her sexual
and emotional confusions remained unresolved.
