<span id="L15" class="LineNr"> 15 </span>ABSTRACT) In this paper the author shares some of his experiences of using silence in therapy.
<span id="L16" class="LineNr"> 16 </span>He presents one of the modes of practicing silence, namely the meditation technique known as
<span id="L17" class="LineNr"> 17 </span>Contemplative Prayer, and shows advantages of using this technique in the process of self-puri
<span id="L18" class="LineNr"> 18 </span>fication and self-balancing of the therapist. The author stipulates that silence is a royal way to
<span id="L19" class="LineNr"> 19 </span>discovering God. Finding this divine particle within oneself and client changes the whole outlook
<span id="L20" class="LineNr"> 20 </span>of therapy. The therapist is no longer alone with the client, but God becomes an active partici
<span id="L21" class="LineNr"> 21 </span>pant in the therapeutic process through His love for both therapist and client.

<span id="L26" class="LineNr"> 26 </span>I discovered the therapeutic importance of silence long before I became a
<span id="L27" class="LineNr"> 27 </span>spiritual person. Around 1982 I had a patient in mania, which manifested
<span id="L28" class="LineNr"> 28 </span>itself mainly through his constant talking. The patient would fill every ses
<span id="L29" class="LineNr"> 29 </span>sion with fast, uninterrupted, intensive talk, making sure that I wouldn't be
<span id="L30" class="LineNr"> 30 </span>able to say anything. I was a young and inexperienced therapist at that time
<span id="L31" class="LineNr"> 31 </span>and the dynamics of the situation were quite frustrating for me. Out of sheer

<span id="L34" class="LineNr"> 34 </span>College of Alberta Psychologists and a Board member of Psychologists* Association of Alberta.

<span id="L41" class="LineNr"> 41 </span>despair I asked the patient to close his eyes. I don't remember how I per
<span id="L42" class="LineNr"> 42 </span>suaded him to do so, but he eventually complied.
<span id="L43" class="LineNr"> 43 </span>What happened next was amazing for me. He continued his fast talk for a
<span id="L44" class="LineNr"> 44 </span>while, but after about 5 minutes began to slow down. He also started to be
<span id="L45" class="LineNr"> 45 </span>more thoughtful about what he was saying. In another few minutes he be
<span id="L46" class="LineNr"> 46 </span>came completely still. He started to breathe more deeply and to be aware of
<span id="L47" class="LineNr"> 47 </span>his body. He was silent for the rest of the session and I was silent with him.
<span id="L48" class="LineNr"> 48 </span>When he finally opened his eyes, he was a transformed person. He noticed
<span id="L49" class="LineNr"> 49 </span>me and began to interact with me. We were no longer a therapist and a pa
<span id="L50" class="LineNr"> 50 </span>tient?we were more like two human beings who had finally met. He never
<span id="L51" class="LineNr"> 51 </span>came for another session, but I had information from his employer that his
<span id="L52" class="LineNr"> 52 </span>functioning had dramatically improved. I like to think that he was healed
<span id="L53" class="LineNr"> 53 </span>through this experience of silence. Naturally he could have realized that he
<span id="L54" class="LineNr"> 54 </span>would not be successful in using his manic tirades to control me. In this case,
<span id="L55" class="LineNr"> 55 </span>I could say, at least I was spared.
<span id="L56" class="LineNr"> 56 </span>Principles and practice of Contemplative Prayer
<span id="L57" class="LineNr"> 57 </span>This experience was so positive for me that I frequently ask people to close
<span id="L58" class="LineNr"> 58 </span>their eyes during psychotherapy. In most cases this is slightly uncomfortable
<span id="L59" class="LineNr"> 59 </span>in the beginning, as we use eyes to control our environment, but the silence
<span id="L60" class="LineNr"> 60 </span>seems to lead quickly to better contact with one's own body and emotions. It
<span id="L61" class="LineNr"> 61 </span>improves the ability to be &quot;here and now.&quot; I use this simple art myself many
<span id="L62" class="LineNr"> 62 </span>times through the day (as, I believe many people do instinctively), especially
<span id="L63" class="LineNr"> 63 </span>when I feel tense or emotionally unbalanced, or when I have a headache. It
<span id="L64" class="LineNr"> 64 </span>takes at times only a few minutes, even seconds, to restore the sense of
<span id="L65" class="LineNr"> 65 </span>wholeness and comfort.
<span id="L66" class="LineNr"> 66 </span>Over the years I have been experimenting with different forms of medita
<span id="L67" class="LineNr"> 67 </span>tion that have involved closed eyes and silence. Recently I have chosen Con
<span id="L68" class="LineNr"> 68 </span>templative Prayer due its simplicity and a belief that in contemplation one
<span id="L69" class="LineNr"> 69 </span>meets the Living God. Contemplative Prayer is traced to the writings of the
<span id="L70" class="LineNr"> 70 </span>anonymous XHI-century author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing.&quot;3 The main
<span id="L71" class="LineNr"> 71 </span>thesis ofthat writer, explaining the title of the book, is that the rational mind
<span id="L72" class="LineNr"> 72 </span>cannot comprehend God. This sphere, or cloud, of the unknown, the author
<span id="L73" class="LineNr"> 73 </span>maintains, can only be penetrated by a humble soul with the &quot;naked intent&quot;
<span id="L74" class="LineNr"> 74 </span>to love God. The word &quot;naked&quot; implies that the practitioner has no expecta
<span id="L75" class="LineNr"> 75 </span>tions for a reward. Love is already its own reward. The meditation calls for
<span id="L76" class="LineNr"> 76 </span>two periods of at least 20 minutes of silence a day. What works best for me is
<span id="L77" class="LineNr"> 77 </span>to start my day in the office with one such period at around 9 a.m. and then
<span id="L78" class="LineNr"> 78 </span>to repeat it at about 3 p.m. The first period helps me to collect my thoughts
<span id="L79" class="LineNr"> 79 </span>and ground myself in a certain detachment from things before I engage my
<span id="L80" class="LineNr"> 80 </span>self in any therapy. The second allows me to regain focus and to rebalance my
<span id="L81" class="LineNr"> 81 </span>energy.
<span id="L82" class="LineNr"> 82 </span>Piotr Rajski 183
<span id="L83" class="LineNr"> 83 </span>&quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; was brought back from obscurity during the last
<span id="L84" class="LineNr"> 84 </span>40 years mainly due to efforts of the American Trappist monks. Among them
<span id="L85" class="LineNr"> 85 </span>the names of Thomas Merton, Thomas Keating, Basil Permington and
<span id="L86" class="LineNr"> 86 </span>Thomas Clarke stand most prominently.4 Instruction for this meditation is
<span id="L87" class="LineNr"> 87 </span>quite simple:
<span id="L88" class="LineNr"> 88 </span>Rules of the Contemplative Prayer
<span id="L89" class="LineNr"> 89 </span>1. At the beginning of the prayer we take a minute or two to quiet down and
<span id="L90" class="LineNr"> 90 </span>then move in faith to God dwelling in our depths. (. . . ) We center all our
<span id="L91" class="LineNr"> 91 </span>attention and desire on Him.
<span id="L92" class="LineNr"> 92 </span>2. After resting for a bit in the center in faithful love, we take up a single,
<span id="L93" class="LineNr"> 93 </span>simple word that expresses our response and begin to let it repeat itself
<span id="L94" class="LineNr"> 94 </span>within.
<span id="L95" class="LineNr"> 95 </span>3. Whenever in the course of the prayer we become aware of anything else,
<span id="L96" class="LineNr"> 96 </span>we simply gently return to the prayer word. We ignore the thoughts and
<span id="L97" class="LineNr"> 97 </span>images offered by the mind (...). We leave them behind, for we want
<span id="L98" class="LineNr"> 98 </span>immediate contact with God Himself, and not some thought, image or
<span id="L99" class="LineNr"> 99 </span>vision of Him.
<span id="L100" class="LineNr">100 </span>4. At the end we take several minutes to come out, mentally praying the
<span id="L101" class="LineNr">101 </span>Lord's Prayer.5
<span id="L102" class="LineNr">102 </span>Christian roots of this prayer/meditation definitely make it unique as most
<span id="L103" class="LineNr">103 </span>of the best known meditation techniques are associated with the East. In my
<span id="L104" class="LineNr">104 </span>opinion, however, all the meditative practices attempt to achieve the same or
<span id="L105" class="LineNr">105 </span>similar goal. These are some of the basic assumptions of this practice as ex
<span id="L106" class="LineNr">106 </span>pressed by its founders.
<span id="L107" class="LineNr">107 </span>1. God is our being. &quot;God present in us, present all around us, is calling us
<span id="L108" class="LineNr">108 </span>to respond to His presence, His love, His caring/'6
<span id="L109" class="LineNr">109 </span>2. Contemplation is a gift. &quot;Every prayer is a response to a movement of
<span id="L110" class="LineNr">110 </span>grace, whether we are aware of it or not&quot;1
<span id="L111" class="LineNr">111 </span>3. God is a mystery. &quot;Thought cannot comprehend God. And so I prefer to
<span id="L112" class="LineNr">112 </span>abandon all I can know, choosing rather to love Him whom I cannot
<span id="L113" class="LineNr">113 </span>know.&quot;8
<span id="L114" class="LineNr">114 </span>4. Love is the only way. &quot;Only love can touch God as He is in Himself&quot;9
<span id="L115" class="LineNr">115 </span>5. Spiritual act is instantaneous. &quot;As soon as we move in love to God pre
<span id="L116" class="LineNr">116 </span>sent in our depths, we are there. There a perfect prayer of adoration, love
<span id="L117" class="LineNr">117 </span>and presence is.mo
<span id="L118" class="LineNr">118 </span>6. Center contains everything. &quot;When I make the journey to the Center, then
<span id="L119" class="LineNr">119 </span>I am where I can touch and be present to all that is, including God Him
<span id="L120" class="LineNr">120 </span>self&quot;11
<span id="L121" class="LineNr">121 </span>184 Journal of Religion and Health
<span id="L122" class="LineNr">122 </span>Contemplative Prayer, then, involves: desire to be with God, an act of love
<span id="L123" class="LineNr">123 </span>which eventually can be extended to human beings; the humble acknowledg
<span id="L124" class="LineNr">124 </span>ment of one's own ignorance; openness to guidance; and the ability to be
<span id="L125" class="LineNr">125 </span>&quot;here-and-now.&quot; The last point assumes that center contains everything and
<span id="L126" class="LineNr">126 </span>implies that by undertaking this effort the therapist may find all the solu
<span id="L127" class="LineNr">127 </span>tions he may need, an understanding of the client's problem and a sense of
<span id="L128" class="LineNr">128 </span>how to help that may have evaded the rational mind.
<span id="L129" class="LineNr">129 </span>The sacred art of silence
<span id="L130" class="LineNr">130 </span>I have had this sense of sacredness of silence for quite some time. It was only
<span id="L131" class="LineNr">131 </span>a few years ago though, after I discovered Contemplative Prayer, read
<span id="L132" class="LineNr">132 </span>Brother Lawrence's &quot;The Practice of the Presence of God&quot; and other mystical
<span id="L133" class="LineNr">133 </span>writings, that I started to see silence as a path to God within myself. I came
<span id="L134" class="LineNr">134 </span>to the conclusion that when the therapist and the client are silent, they cre
<span id="L135" class="LineNr">135 </span>ate a certain communion, as divine particles in them come into contact with
<span id="L136" class="LineNr">136 </span>each other.
<span id="L137" class="LineNr">137 </span>What do I talk about? Let me give you one example. I once worked with
<span id="L138" class="LineNr">138 </span>an autistic, 11-year-old boy, who was causing many problems at school. I
<span id="L139" class="LineNr">139 </span>thought that his inability to communicate was the source of his frustration.
<span id="L140" class="LineNr">140 </span>When frustrated he would become stubborn, uncooperative and occasionally
<span id="L141" class="LineNr">141 </span>aggressive. The school authorities seemed to have a limited understanding
<span id="L142" class="LineNr">142 </span>of his condition and often mishandled his behaviors, thus adding to the
<span id="L143" class="LineNr">143 </span>problem. As a result of these dynamics, the boy stopped communicating
<span id="L144" class="LineNr">144 </span>with the outside world and, as I was a part of this world, he did not want to
<span id="L145" class="LineNr">145 </span>communicate with me. As talking to him was not producing any results I
<span id="L146" class="LineNr">146 </span>chose at some point just to be silent with him. I would visit with his family
<span id="L147" class="LineNr">147 </span>and spend time sitting quietly in his room observing his play. Gradually this
<span id="L148" class="LineNr">148 </span>common silence created a bond between us. I think he received the message
<span id="L149" class="LineNr">149 </span>that I respected his &quot;silent world&quot; and that I did not have any intention of
<span id="L150" class="LineNr">150 </span>imposing things on him. With time, he started to invite me to a parallel play
<span id="L151" class="LineNr">151 </span>and then to join his play. He said a few words, I said a few words, and soon
<span id="L152" class="LineNr">152 </span>we made friends. He became more relaxed at school and it helped his
<span id="L153" class="LineNr">153 </span>teachers to relax. He passed successfully to the next grade and his school
<span id="L154" class="LineNr">154 </span>career became smoother. Although other forms of intervention also played a
<span id="L155" class="LineNr">155 </span>role here, I think it was this common silence that was the crux of the thera
<span id="L156" class="LineNr">156 </span>peutic process.
<span id="L157" class="LineNr">157 </span>This case illustrates something that I have difficulty persuading my youn
<span id="L158" class="LineNr">158 </span>ger colleagues to see; important things happen during therapy even when the
<span id="L159" class="LineNr">159 </span>therapist and the client say nothing. Tb paraphrase the words of Dalai Lama,
<span id="L160" class="LineNr">160 </span>&quot;there is a lot to do (in therapy), but also a lot not to do.&quot; If a therapist is a
<span id="L161" class="LineNr">161 </span>peaceful, balanced, and possibly a spiritually oriented person, then the heal
<span id="L162" class="LineNr">162 </span>ing begins at the moment the client is in proximity to the therapist. It hap
<span id="L163" class="LineNr">163 </span>Piotr Rajski 185
<span id="L164" class="LineNr">164 </span>pens even if the therapist does not offer life changing insights, break-through
<span id="L165" class="LineNr">165 </span>interpretations, suggestions and recommendations. Just by being in touch
<span id="L166" class="LineNr">166 </span>with a peaceful therapist, or for that matter, with any peaceful person, the
<span id="L167" class="LineNr">167 </span>client can discover the space of silence and peace within himself. This may
<span id="L168" class="LineNr">168 </span>lead, with time, to a sense of God's Presence within which very often releases
<span id="L169" class="LineNr">169 </span>clients from anguish, sorrow, and whatever other tribulations might have
<span id="L170" class="LineNr">170 </span>brought them into therapy.
<span id="L171" class="LineNr">171 </span>What is the nature of this healing power of silence? Three things come to
<span id="L172" class="LineNr">172 </span>mind. It appears that first and foremost silence allows for the release of an
<span id="L173" class="LineNr">173 </span>unconscious psychological material. If so, as the experiences of many mystics
<span id="L174" class="LineNr">174 </span>seem to suggest, then God, who is in silence, could be described as the Divine
<span id="L175" class="LineNr">175 </span>Therapist. Through silence, a therapist has a chance to get into contact with
<span id="L176" class="LineNr">176 </span>a mystery that is bigger than the manifested world and the therapist himself.
<span id="L177" class="LineNr">177 </span>This helps to put therapy in a proper context. Going into silence also helps
<span id="L178" class="LineNr">178 </span>the therapist to derive benefits of so called &quot;relaxation response.&quot; On a spiri
<span id="L179" class="LineNr">179 </span>tual level, this &quot;relaxation response&quot; involves perception of an inner cosmos
<span id="L180" class="LineNr">180 </span>and of Personal Godhead. This contact with the Source of Life brings rest and
<span id="L181" class="LineNr">181 </span>renewal of one's own strength.
<span id="L182" class="LineNr">182 </span>God?the Divine Therapist
<span id="L183" class="LineNr">183 </span>Most people have a certain apprehension when being alone and not having
<span id="L184" class="LineNr">184 </span>anyone to talk to. It seems that silence, depriving the mind of overt stimula
<span id="L185" class="LineNr">185 </span>tion, brings up all the unconscious fears, conflicts and confusions one may
<span id="L186" class="LineNr">186 </span>have. This is how one of the founders of Contemplative Prayer, Father
<span id="L187" class="LineNr">187 </span>Thomas Keating, refers to the process:
<span id="L188" class="LineNr">188 </span>&quot;Any form of meditation or prayer that transcends thinking sets off the dy
<span id="L189" class="LineNr">189 </span>namic of interior purification. This dynamic is a kind of divine psychotherapy.
<span id="L190" class="LineNr">190 </span>The experience facilitates the coming to consciousness of ones motivation and
<span id="L191" class="LineNr">191 </span>evil tendencies, and sometimes enables the organism to release deep rooted
<span id="L192" class="LineNr">192 </span>tension in the form of thoughts.&quot;12 He adds in another of his books: &quot;The spiri
<span id="L193" class="LineNr">193 </span>tual journey from this aspect is a course in growing up and becoming liberated
<span id="L194" class="LineNr">194 </span>from childhood fixations at emotional levels that have become disruptive of
<span id="L195" class="LineNr">195 </span>our adult life and that interfere with our relationships. The journey is a form
<span id="L196" class="LineNr">196 </span>of divine psychotherapy in which God tries to heal us on every level, beginning
<span id="L197" class="LineNr">197 </span>normally with the body and the emotions.&quot;13
<span id="L198" class="LineNr">198 </span>What does this mean practically? When I sit silent for 20 minutes my mind
<span id="L199" class="LineNr">199 </span>spend 90% of the time wobbling, wandering and worrying about things. This
<span id="L200" class="LineNr">200 </span>alone gives me a valuable insight into the state of my mind. It gives me a
<span id="L201" class="LineNr">201 </span>chance to look into my irrationalities and inconsistencies. If I want, I can
<span id="L202" class="LineNr">202 </span>correct my thinking by choosing thoughts that are more rational, positive and
<span id="L203" class="LineNr">203 </span>solution oriented. I may introduce some changes in my life, in my lifestyle,
<span id="L204" class="LineNr">204 </span>the way I conduct my business or relate to my family members. Becoming
<span id="L205" class="LineNr">205 </span>186 Journal of Religion and Health
<span id="L206" class="LineNr">206 </span>aware of my own inadequacies makes me more humble and tolerant of my
<span id="L207" class="LineNr">207 </span>clients' weaknesses and vices. If I ask them to practice silence, I need to know
<span id="L208" class="LineNr">208 </span>what the &quot;taste&quot; of silence is. In silence I often find solutions to my counter
<span id="L209" class="LineNr">209 </span>transference problems; I start to understand what makes me uneasy with
<span id="L210" class="LineNr">210 </span>that particular client, and to generate some ideas us to what I can do differ
<span id="L211" class="LineNr">211 </span>ently.
<span id="L212" class="LineNr">212 </span>Among these deep-rooted apprehensions of ours is the fear of God Himself.
<span id="L213" class="LineNr">213 </span>This is how Gerald W. Hughes describes the dynamic: &quot;we are so afraid of
<span id="L214" class="LineNr">214 </span>silence that we chase ourselves from one event to the next in order not to have
<span id="L215" class="LineNr">215 </span>to spend a moment alone with ourselves, in order not to have to look at our
<span id="L216" class="LineNr">216 </span>selves in the mirror. We know that those times when we have to be alone are
<span id="L217" class="LineNr">217 </span>often the most comfortless and fruitless of times for us. But we are not only
<span id="L218" class="LineNr">218 </span>afraid of ourselves and of self-discovery, we are much more afraid of God?
<span id="L219" class="LineNr">219 </span>that he may disturb us and discover who we really are, that he may take us
<span id="L220" class="LineNr">220 </span>with him into his solitude and deal with us according to his will. We are
<span id="L221" class="LineNr">221 </span>afraid of such lonely, awful encounters with God, and we avoid them, so that
<span id="L222" class="LineNr">222 </span>he may not suddenly come too near to us. It would be too dreadful to have to
<span id="L223" class="LineNr">223 </span>face God directly, to have to answer to him. (...). This anxiety is a mark of
<span id="L224" class="LineNr">224 </span>our times; we live in fear that we may suddenly find ourselves before the Eter
<span id="L225" class="LineNr">225 </span>nal&quot;1'
<span id="L226" class="LineNr">226 </span>This fear of the Eternal may take many forms. One of the most popular is
<span id="L227" class="LineNr">227 </span>the position that &quot;God is not scientific enough.&quot; In our secular science there is
<span id="L228" class="LineNr">228 </span>generally no money for research associated with spiritual values. The state
<span id="L229" class="LineNr">229 </span>ment, &quot;There is no God&quot;, is a priori &quot;scientific,&quot; while the statement, &quot;There is
<span id="L230" class="LineNr">230 </span>God&quot; is non-scientific. The same happens in our clinical practice. Behavioral,
<span id="L231" class="LineNr">231 </span>or cognitive-behavioral treatments are supported and paid for. Anything that
<span id="L232" class="LineNr">232 </span>tries to see human beings beyond the &quot;stimulus-response&quot; conceptualization
<span id="L233" class="LineNr">233 </span>is looked at with suspicion. For those who want to be in charge, in control, the
<span id="L234" class="LineNr">234 </span>Eternal is an unnecessary and, in fact, unwanted concept. Characteristically,
<span id="L235" class="LineNr">235 </span>such people have little interest in silence, where the Eternal or Transcenden
<span id="L236" class="LineNr">236 </span>tal can be met.
<span id="L237" class="LineNr">237 </span>Transcendental reality in therapy
<span id="L238" class="LineNr">238 </span>Contemplative Prayer, however, or any other form of meditation or prayer,
<span id="L239" class="LineNr">239 </span>may change the whole outlook of therapy because it brings a &quot;transcendental
<span id="L240" class="LineNr">240 </span>element&quot; or &quot;transcendental reality&quot; to therapy. This change takes place pro
<span id="L241" class="LineNr">241 </span>portionally to the therapist's ability to sense the Presence of the Higher Intel
<span id="L242" class="LineNr">242 </span>ligence. I believe that the lives of most human beings could be compared to a
<span id="L243" class="LineNr">243 </span>journey through a maze. People constantly struggle with unending material
<span id="L244" class="LineNr">244 </span>problems?how to make enough money to feed themselves and their off
<span id="L245" class="LineNr">245 </span>spring, how to get ahead of others, how to preserve relationships, get children
<span id="L246" class="LineNr">246 </span>through college, and so on. In this struggle they often get lost, and this is
<span id="L247" class="LineNr">247 </span>when they come to therapy seeking advice and direction. The problem is that
<span id="L248" class="LineNr">248 </span>Piotr Rajski 187
<span id="L249" class="LineNr">249 </span>most of the therapists are also lost in the maze. Often psychological interven
<span id="L250" class="LineNr">250 </span>tions are like telling the client to go down two blocks, then turn right, and
<span id="L251" class="LineNr">251 </span>then left. Although these interventions may reduce some suffering, and im
<span id="L252" class="LineNr">252 </span>prove things temporarily, they leave people in the maze of material existence.
<span id="L253" class="LineNr">253 </span>The only solution to the material maze is to look to the Creator of the maze.
<span id="L254" class="LineNr">254 </span>Seeing this transcendental aspect of our reality is &quot;liberation.&quot;
<span id="L255" class="LineNr">255 </span>In many cases, in our world of managed health care and emphasis on short
<span id="L256" class="LineNr">256 </span>term counseling, there is not enough time to create even a temporary relief
<span id="L257" class="LineNr">257 </span>for our clients. Poverty, ignorance, cultural and language barriers can create
<span id="L258" class="LineNr">258 </span>enormous obstacles to psychological interventions.15 Often therapists deal
<span id="L259" class="LineNr">259 </span>with cases that are more of a moral than psychological nature (e.g. sexual
<span id="L260" class="LineNr">260 </span>orientation, incest or abortion). In all of these situations, I believe, bringing
<span id="L261" class="LineNr">261 </span>this &quot;transcendental element&quot; to therapy is the best or sometimes the only
<span id="L262" class="LineNr">262 </span>chance for progress. This approach is not new. For instance, the Second Step
<span id="L263" class="LineNr">263 </span>of the Alcoholics Anonymous program employs the strategy (calling upon a
<span id="L264" class="LineNr">264 </span>&quot;Power greater than myself&quot;), and perhaps is behind the success of this orga
<span id="L265" class="LineNr">265 </span>nization. There are several ways of bringing this &quot;transcendental reality&quot; into
<span id="L266" class="LineNr">266 </span>therapy. First, the therapist may gently inquire about the spiritual beliefs of
<span id="L267" class="LineNr">267 </span>the client and have a conversation on this subject. Second, the therapist may
<span id="L268" class="LineNr">268 </span>pray with the client, or if the client is reluctant to do so, pray for the client in
<span id="L269" class="LineNr">269 </span>privacy. There is a growing body of research suggesting that such intentional
<span id="L270" class="LineNr">270 </span>prayers in fact do work. But the best chance lies in asking the client to close
<span id="L271" class="LineNr">271 </span>his/her eyes and practice silence.
<span id="L272" class="LineNr">272 </span>Bringing the transcendental reality into counseling means that it is no
<span id="L273" class="LineNr">273 </span>longer just the therapist and the client who participate in the process, but
<span id="L274" class="LineNr">274 </span>that there is a higher power, who is a witness to every word being said and
<span id="L275" class="LineNr">275 </span>who is lovingly interested in the success of the therapy. His presence takes
<span id="L276" class="LineNr">276 </span>some burden off the therapist's shoulders and may prevent burnout. As ther
<span id="L277" class="LineNr">277 </span>apists, we may have the illusion that we are more in control of the clients'
<span id="L278" class="LineNr">278 </span>lives than is the case. For instance, I may do everything in my power to
<span id="L279" class="LineNr">279 </span>reduce the suicidal intent of my clients, but ultimately I am unable to control
<span id="L280" class="LineNr">280 </span>them after they leave my office. Being able to call upon God (if you don't
<span id="L281" class="LineNr">281 </span>decide to call the police) to take care of the client is then a priceless resource,
<span id="L282" class="LineNr">282 </span>are, however, available only to those who believe.
<span id="L283" class="LineNr">283 </span>God?Renewer of Life
<span id="L284" class="LineNr">284 </span>During the 20 minutes of the Contemplative Prayer's silence I spend 1-2
<span id="L285" class="LineNr">285 </span>minutes in contact with God Himself. I go beyond my mind and feel the pres
<span id="L286" class="LineNr">286 </span>ence of &quot;something,&quot; which is infinitely wiser, more powerful and more loving
<span id="L287" class="LineNr">287 </span>than I am. These are the most cherished and sweet moments of my life. I feel
<span id="L288" class="LineNr">288 </span>loved the way I am, and I feel that everything is right. During these precious
<span id="L289" class="LineNr">289 </span>seconds God, Infinite Intelligence, renews my spirit. I come back and I am
<span id="L290" class="LineNr">290 </span>capable of functioning again. Miraculously, I find a new energy to undertake
<span id="L291" class="LineNr">291 </span>188 Journal of Religion and Health
<span id="L292" class="LineNr">292 </span>yet another attack on the windmills of our civilization, to continue with my
<span id="L293" class="LineNr">293 </span>duties, to see yet another client. I go into silence distraught, and I come back
<span id="L294" class="LineNr">294 </span>smiling. This experience is so powerful that I would like to share it with all
<span id="L295" class="LineNr">295 </span>my clients and colleagues. But I can't, because it is almost impossible to de
<span id="L296" class="LineNr">296 </span>scribe. Many mystics have tried and failed. The only thing I can do is to
<span id="L297" class="LineNr">297 </span>encourage my clients to practice silence and to discover it by themselves.
<span id="L298" class="LineNr">298 </span>Reading the proponents of the Contemplative Prayer, and other mystical
<span id="L299" class="LineNr">299 </span>literature, may offer some inspiration here. Thomas Keating wrote for in
<span id="L300" class="LineNr">300 </span>stance: &quot;The presence of God is like the atmosphere we breathe. (. . . ) Nothing
<span id="L301" class="LineNr">301 </span>is more delightful than the divine presence. (. . . ) To know God in this way is
<span id="L302" class="LineNr">302 </span>to perceive a new dimension to all reality. The ripe fruit of this prayer is to
<span id="L303" class="LineNr">303 </span>bring back into the humdrum routine of ordinary life not just the thought of
<span id="L304" class="LineNr">304 </span>God, but the constant awareness of His presence beyond any concept.&quot;1*
<span id="L305" class="LineNr">305 </span>The beatified Polish mystic, Sister Faustina Kowalska noted: In my opin
<span id="L306" class="LineNr">306 </span>ion, and according to my experience, the rule concerning silence should stand
<span id="L307" class="LineNr">307 </span>in the very first place. God does not give himself to a chattering soul, which
<span id="L308" class="LineNr">308 </span>like a drone in a beehive, buzzes around but gathers no honey. A talkative
<span id="L309" class="LineNr">309 </span>soul is empty inside. It lacks both essential virtues and intimacy with God. A
<span id="L310" class="LineNr">310 </span>deeper interior life, one of gentle peace and ofthat silence where God dwells,
<span id="L311" class="LineNr">311 </span>is quite out of the question. A soul that never tasted the sweetness of inner
<span id="L312" class="LineNr">312 </span>silence is a restless spirit, which disturbs the silence of others.'91'1 What hap
<span id="L313" class="LineNr">313 </span>pens when this &quot;restless spirit&quot; belongs to a therapist? Faustina later ob
<span id="L314" class="LineNr">314 </span>served: &quot;My life at present flows on in peaceful awareness of God. My silent
<span id="L315" class="LineNr">315 </span>soul lives on Him, and this conscious life of God in my soul is for me a source
<span id="L316" class="LineNr">316 </span>of happiness and strength. ( . . . ) Silence is so powerful a language that it
<span id="L317" class="LineNr">317 </span>reaches the throne of the living God. Silence is His language, though secret,
<span id="L318" class="LineNr">318 </span>yet living and powerful.&quot;18
<span id="L319" class="LineNr">319 </span>Calls for silence can be found in each of the religious traditions and are not
<span id="L320" class="LineNr">320 </span>limited to the East. I have collected and made available many of them online.19
<span id="L321" class="LineNr">321 </span>Interestingly for Christians, Our Lady, through Her apparitions in Med
<span id="L322" class="LineNr">322 </span>jugorie, also stresses the importance of this practice: &quot;I beseech you, withdraw
<span id="L323" class="LineNr">323 </span>in silence. Your obligation is not so much to do, but to adore God, to stay with
<span id="L324" class="LineNr">324 </span>Him.&quot;20 In yet another apparition She said: &quot;Dear children, today I am calling
<span id="L325" class="LineNr">325 </span>you to renew your heart. Open yourself to God and surrender to Him all your
<span id="L326" class="LineNr">326 </span>difficulties and crosses so God may turn everything into joy. Little children,
<span id="L327" class="LineNr">327 </span>you cannot open yourselves to God if you do not pray; therefore, from today
<span id="L328" class="LineNr">328 </span>decide to consecrate a time and a day only for an encounter with God in si
<span id="L329" class="LineNr">329 </span>lence. (,..)&quot;21
<span id="L330" class="LineNr">330 </span>Summary
<span id="L331" class="LineNr">331 </span>I believe that in this short paper I have signaled some advantages of practic
<span id="L332" class="LineNr">332 </span>ing silence, both for the therapeutic purposes and for the sake of the thera
<span id="L333" class="LineNr">333 </span>Piotr Rajski 189
<span id="L334" class="LineNr">334 </span>pist's growth. The main advantage of being silent lies in an opportunity to
<span id="L335" class="LineNr">335 </span>feel God's Presence with many beneficial consequences derived from this
<span id="L336" class="LineNr">336 </span>state. Practicing two periods of twenty minutes of silence a day, as recom
<span id="L337" class="LineNr">337 </span>mended by practitioners of Contemplative Prayer, is feasible in the context of
<span id="L338" class="LineNr">338 </span>average private practice and brings many positive fruits. Among the thera
<span id="L339" class="LineNr">339 </span>peutic fruits of this practice one could list a release of unconscious psychologi
<span id="L340" class="LineNr">340 </span>cal material and a subsequent reduction of emotional tension. Silence brings
<span id="L341" class="LineNr">341 </span>a sense of balance and harmony. Including God into the equation of therapy
<span id="L342" class="LineNr">342 </span>leads to a proper distance to problems that do not belong to the therapist and
<span id="L343" class="LineNr">343 </span>the client only, but also to God. Spending time in the beam of God's love
<span id="L344" class="LineNr">344 </span>brings comfort and a sense of being loved and accepted. It provides new en
<span id="L345" class="LineNr">345 </span>ergy to do things. Some of the other personal gains from this practice were
<span id="L346" class="LineNr">346 </span>poetically described almost 700 years ago by the author of &quot;The Cloud of Un
<span id="L347" class="LineNr">347 </span>knowing&quot;: &quot;Your whole personality will be transformed, your countenance will
<span id="L348" class="LineNr">348 </span>radiate an inner beauty, and for as long as you feel it nothing will sadden you.
<span id="L349" class="LineNr">349 </span>(. . . ) Your words will be few, but fruitful and full of fire. . . . Your silence will
<span id="L350" class="LineNr">350 </span>be peaceful, (. . . ) and your prayer secret in the depth of your being. Your self
<span id="L351" class="LineNr">351 </span>esteem will be natural and unspoiled by conceit, your way with others gentle,
<span id="L352" class="LineNr">352 </span>and your laughter merry (. . . )&quot;22
